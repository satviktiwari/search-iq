The offerings provide \npriority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement \nservices, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country \nand type of product.\nCloud Services\nThe Company’s cloud services store and keep customers’ content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and \nWindows personal computers.\nDigital Content\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store®, that allow customers to discover and download applications \nand digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts.\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade®, a game subscription \nservice; Apple Fitness+SM, a personalized fitness service; Apple Music®, which offers users a curated listening experience with \non-demand radio stations; Apple News+®, a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+®, which offers exclusive \noriginal content and live sports.\nPayment Services\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card®, a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay®, a cashless payment \nservice.\nSegments\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the \nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe \nincludes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong \nand Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable \nsegments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is \nmanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market \ndynamics of each geographic region.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government \nmarkets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers \nthrough its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution \nchannels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2024, the Company’s net \nsales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price \ncompetition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short \nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid \nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of \nthe Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating \nthe Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 2\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative \nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for \nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal \ncompetitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative \nprice and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and \naccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables \nand accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have \nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings \nwith large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products \nand a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut \nprices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products \nat little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for \nfree and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition \nas competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated \nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain \ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with \nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the \nCompany will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s \nability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, \nservices and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing \nproducts and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D”), licensing of \nintellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware, \naccessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of \nintellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such \nintellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such \nownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, \ndevelopment, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the \nCompany has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single \nintellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and services. The Company believes the \nduration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include \nintellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various \naspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such \nlicenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future \non reasonable terms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 3\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \nsales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect \ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an \nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and \ndistributors anticipate a product introduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and retain the best \ntalent. The Company works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members, so that its \npeople can do the best work of their lives. As of September  28, 2024, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time \nequivalent employees.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the \nCompany’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their \nneeds and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide \nvariety of benefits for employees around the world, including health, wellness and time away.\nGrowth and Development\nThe Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers programs \nthrough Apple University on leadership, management and influence, as well as Apple culture and values. Team members can \nalso take advantage of online classes for business, technical and personal development, as well as learning opportunities to \nsupport their well-being.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of \nharassment or discrimination.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities \nit serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and \nsupport equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\nEngagement\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an \nopen, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to \ncome to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee \nsentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace \nrisks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security \nand crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard \nenvironments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers \nthrough its global security team.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 4\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and \namendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \n“Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

      "section_content": "Risk Factors\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of \nfactors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize \nfrom time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially \nand adversely affected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, \npast financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not \nuse historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking \nstatements.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition \nand Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial \nStatements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and \nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial \ncondition.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. \nIn addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, including \nmanufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend \nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher \ninterest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely \naffect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially \nadversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset \nvalues, and other economic factors.\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global \nor regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics \nproviders, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial \ninstability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the \nfailure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced \nliquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially \nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 5\nThe Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical \ntensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business \ninterruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health \nissues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its \ncustomers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other \nchannel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, \nand the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’s \nmanufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South \nKorea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, \ntechnology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly \nsignificant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its \nrevenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company’s products \nand the components and raw materials that go into them, and can require the Company to take various actions, including \nchanging suppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and distribute affected products, \nservices and third-party applications to its customers. Changing the Company’s business and supply chain in accordance with \nnew or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s \noperations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company \nmay not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, \nincluding the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions affecting the Company’s business. If disputes \nand conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive \nand could materially adversely affect the Company’s business.\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract \nmanufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is resulting in \ncertain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In addition, the \nCompany’s and its suppliers’ operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear \npower plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity \nattacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company’s control. For example, global supply chains \ncan be highly concentrated and geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create \ndelays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s \nservice offerings, increase the Company’s costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While \nthe Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur \nand could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. \nMajor public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the \nfuture materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; \nthe imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight \nservices and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales \nand distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays \nin production ramps of new products and development of new services.\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant \nexpenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the \nsupply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any \nnegative consequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such \ninsurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 6\nGlobal markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological \nchange, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price \ncompetition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short \nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid \nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative \nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for \nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the \nCompany must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected \nreturns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to \nregister, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete \nprimarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on \nits  intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the \nCompany operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if \ncompetitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be \nmaterially adversely affected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces \nsubstantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other \nresources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the \nCompany’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. \nCompetition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain \ncompetitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of \nthe markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications \nwithin their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also \nexpects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their \nofferings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and \nexperience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models \nthat provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content \nand applications.\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to \ncontinually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the \nCompany will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\nBusiness Risks\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions \nand transitions of products and services.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company \nmust continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively \nstimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new \nand upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, \nincluding timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new \ntechnologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software or other third-party support for the \nCompany’s products and services, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with \nanticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated \ndemand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. New products, services \nand technologies may replace or supersede existing offerings and may produce lower revenues and lower profit margins, which \ncan materially adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no \nassurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 7\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing \npartners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in \nChina mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is \ncurrently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced \nmuch of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the \nCompany’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future \nhave an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the \nCompany’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for \nproduct defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-\nwarranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While \nthe Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from \ntime to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many \ncomponents, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s \nhardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of \ncomponents or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be \ndisrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial \ndisputes, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, trade and other international disputes, \ngeopolitical tensions, or conflict.\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, \nand has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements \nhelp ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial \nproblems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be disrupted or terminated, and the recoverability of \nmanufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\nChanges or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and \nuncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on \ncommercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant \nsupply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to \nindustry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s \nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past \nexperienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities \nof components and products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the \nCompany has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able \nto extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. In addition, component suppliers may suffer from poor financial \nconditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the \nCompany’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the \nCompany remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its \nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product \nuses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing \ncapacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any \nnumber of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components \ncustomized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has \nbeen delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the \nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints \ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business \nand financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient \nquantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 8\nThe Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could \nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing \ndefects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues \nthat can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist \nin components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s \nproducts unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the \nCompany’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings \ncan have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the \nCompany’s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and \ncomplex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety risks, including exposing users \nto harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect \nand fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical \nand performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. Errors, bugs and vulnerabilities can be exploited by \nthird parties, compromising the safety and security of a user’s device. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product \nliability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible \nassets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can \nadversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s \nreputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new \nproduct and service introductions and lost sales.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase \ncommitment cancellation risk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated \ndemand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for \norders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its \nsuppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be \nrecoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which \nthe carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory \nprepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company \nwill not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence \nin the industries in which the Company competes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. \nManufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for \nperiods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price \nchanges, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components \nor products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on \ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires \nlicenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently \ncompetes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the \nCompany’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to \ntime, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. \nBased on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally \nbe obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on \ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such \nintellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can require the Company to modify certain products, services or features \nor preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the \nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 9\nThe Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party \nsoftware applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain \nsoftware applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be \ndeveloped and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products.\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the \ndevelopers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services \nfor the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for \npersonal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on \nfactors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected \nfuture growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\nThe Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers \nless inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to \ndeveloping and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on \nthese competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer.\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its \nproducts. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party \ndevelopers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these \nchanges to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower \ncustomer demand for the Company’s products.\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, \ndevelopers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. Where applicable, the Company retains a commission from \nsales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has \nmade changes to its products and services, including taking actions in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and \nlegal and regulatory requirements, and expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the \nCompany has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the \niOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, \niPadOS, the App Store and Safari® in the European Union (“EU”) as it seeks to comply with the Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”), \nincluding new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS \nand iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional tools and \napplication programming interfaces (“APIs”) for developers. Changes to the Company’s products and services could materially \nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including if such business changes result \nin reduced App Store or other sales, reductions in the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales, or if the \nrate of the commission is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated.\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content available \non commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of \noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or \noffer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company’s own services. \nThe licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the \ncontinuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers \nand distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or \nimpossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may \nseek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a \nwide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for \ntalent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers.\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. \nIf requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be \nno assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 10\nThe Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and \navailability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its distinctive and \ninclusive culture.\nMuch of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and \nservice of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced \npersonnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, \nwhere most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are \nconstantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely \naffect the Company’s culture, reputation and operational flexibility.\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to \nnurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who \nare critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of \noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and \nresellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services \nand resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and \neducation, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment plans or \nsubsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same \namounts.\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected \nresellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can \nrequire a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could \nweaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the \nCompany’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\nThe Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network \ndisruptions.\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to \ninformation technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, \ntelecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other \ncybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be \nineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be \nsufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, \npreventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and \nshipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results \nof operations and financial condition.\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject \nthe Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\nThe Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information with respect to the \nCompany’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to systems and data security, including \nthrough the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot \nprovide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially \nadversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company \nrelies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. \nAlthough the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on \nthe Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential \ninformation occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, \nreputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 11\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. \nThese attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal \nbusiness operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products \nand services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to \nlitigation or government investigations, which can result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks \nare expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques \nthat are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the \nCompany’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers \ncan escalate during periods of geopolitical tensions or conflict.\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many \ncompanies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and \nthe value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent \nunauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of \nencryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all \neventualities and are vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password \nmanagement or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company’s or its suppliers’ and other \nthird parties’ employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be \nused for unauthorized access to the Company’s or such suppliers’ or third parties’ systems and services. To help protect \ncustomers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors \nits services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other \nthings, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such \ninsurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not \noriginally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and \nfinancial condition.\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may \ninvolve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected \nliabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, \nregions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-\noffs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory \napprovals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from \ncompleting a transaction or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These \nnew ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely \naffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the \nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse \neffect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store \nconstruction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the \nvalue of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 12\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable \nresults of legal proceedings or government investigations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary \ncourse of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements \nentered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and \ndamages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government \ninvestigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, \nhas generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and \nnew claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and \nother patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on \nallegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending \ninfringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these \nactions frequently seek broad injunctive relief and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be \nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company \nmay enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance \nsuch agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly \nincrease the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and \nlimit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services.\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against \nthe Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s \nresults of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an \noutcome can result in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or \ninjunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change \nits business practices and limit the Company’s ability to develop, manufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products and \nservices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial \ncondition.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to \ncover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to \npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; \nprivacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services \nand technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and \nartificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; \navailability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; \nforeign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and \nenvironmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely \naffect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or \nfeature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products and services, impacting customer demand for \nthe Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s business or supply chain. New and changing \nlaws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These \nrisks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including \nhealth and financial services, or as the Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial \nintelligence features, and must navigate new legal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies. The \nCompany has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but \nthere can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the \nCompany’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely \naffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 13\nRegulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or \nno advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For \nexample, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company \nhas programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance \nthat such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s \nproducts could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s \nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose \nthe Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s \nbusiness.\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on \nenvironmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas \nemissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals \nand initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other \ncommunications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of the \nCompany’s announced goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-\nparty performance or data that is outside the Company’s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its \nannounced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the \nCompany’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, \nadhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state and international environmental, social and governance laws and \nregulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings \nagainst the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial \ncondition and stock price.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory \nscrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, \ncompetition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes \nin the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers \nwithin apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.\nThe Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the EU as it seeks to comply with the \nDMA, including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution \nfor iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional \ntools and APIs for developers. The Company has also continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to \nfeedback and engagement with the European Commission (the “Commission”). Although the Company’s compliance plan is \nintended to address the DMA’s obligations, it has been challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private \nlitigants. The DMA provides for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the \nCompany to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new \nprivacy and security risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can \nresult in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially \nadverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is subject \nto civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance \nsmartphones” and “smartphones” generally in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of \ninvestigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are \nresolved against the Company, the Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes \nto its business practices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations \nand financial condition.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become \nsubject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the \nCompany’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, \nresults of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with Google \nLLC and other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and applications, and certain of these \narrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 14\nThere can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by \nthe outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s \nbusiness practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings can negatively impact \nthe reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the \nCompany’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market \nacceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\nThe Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations \nregarding data protection.\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, \nsecurity and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party \ntransactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several \njurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have \nlaws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with \nemerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future \nrequire the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information \nprovided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to \ncomply with these public statements or with federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could \nresult in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, \npenalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the \nCompany is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health \ndata, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach \nnotification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance \nwith these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial \ndata is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, \nthe Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, \nand can also incur significant fees or fines.\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder \ninformation is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur \nsignificant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also \nexperience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow \npayment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, \nresults of operations and financial condition.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, \nthe gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross \nmargins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global \nproduct pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased \ncompetition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product \nlife cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, \nacquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs \neffectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that \nregulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; \ninflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or \nservices with lower profit margins. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of \noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \nsales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a \ndecline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to \nunexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new \nproduct or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the \nCompany’s logistics, supply or manufacturing partners.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 15\nThe Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative \nto local currencies.\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost \nof sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that \ninclude components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be \nmaterially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign \ncurrency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing \ndemand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to \nraise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross \nmargins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign \ncurrency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its \nforeign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may \nincrease the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to \nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a \nportion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are \nin place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and \neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of \nthe Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not \nrealized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in \nsignificant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments \nrelated to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, \nretailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and \neducation, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not \ncovered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the \nCompany’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to \ncredit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks \nmay be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by \noutsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In \naddition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory \ncomponents. As of September 28, 2024, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term \nsupply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has \nprocedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term \nprepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to \nadditional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a \nnumber of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income \ntaxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the \nintroduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings \nin countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of \nnew taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant \njudgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 16\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service \nand other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome \nresulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the \noutcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the \nCompany’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of \noperations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nGeneral Risks\nThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.\nThe Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, \nthe Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price \nand volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating \nperformance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to \nexceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future \ngrowth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will \ncontinue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are \nsubject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), and the Company’s share repurchase program does \nnot obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, \nprofitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline \nsignificantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.",

      "section_content": "Legal Proceedings\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the \nCompany under the DMA. The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers \nmay communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may \nconclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, \nand a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced its preliminary findings in the Article \n5(4) investigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a \nthird formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company’s new contractual requirements for third-party \napp developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA. If the Commission makes a final determination that there has been \na violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. \nAlthough any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the \nCommission’s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company \nbelieves that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and \nengagement with the Commission.\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil \nantitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or \nattempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. \nThe DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters \nhave been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary \ndamages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend \nitself.\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California District \nCourt”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based \nupon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App \nStore Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from \nprohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than \nApple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, \n2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California \nDistrict Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the \nCompany has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with \nthe California District Court to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to \nvigorously defend itself.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the \nordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in \nthe aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is \ninherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above \nmanagement’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially \nadversely affected.",

\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for 2024 was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a one-time \nincome tax charge of $10.2  billion, net, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 7, “Income Taxes” in the Notes to \nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) and state income taxes, partially offset by a lower \neffective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from share-based \ncompensation.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for 2024 was higher compared to 2023 due primarily to a one-time income tax charge of \n$10.2 billion, net, related to the State Aid Decision, a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings and lower tax benefits from \nshare-based compensation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which totaled $140.8 billion \nas of September 28, 2024, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be \nsufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.\nThe Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations:\nDebt\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal \namount of $97.3 billion (collectively the “Notes”), with $10.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments \nassociated with the Notes total $38.5 billion, with $2.6 billion payable within 12 months.\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of \nSeptember  28, 2024, the Company had $10.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 \nmonths.\nLeases\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and \nretail space. As of September  28, 2024, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.6 billion, with $2.0 billion \npayable within 12 months.\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform \nfinal assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide \nvariety of individual suppliers. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.0 billion, \nwith $52.9 billion payable within 12 months.\nOther Purchase Obligations\nThe Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including \nassets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual \nproperty and content, and distribution rights. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had other purchase obligations of $12.0 \nbillion, with $4.1 billion payable within 12 months.\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\nAs of September 28, 2024, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of \n2017 (the “TCJA”) was $16.5 billion, with $7.2 billion expected to be paid within 12 months.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 25\nState Aid Decision Tax Payable\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Company had an obligation to pay €14.2 billion or $15.8 billion to Ireland in connection with the \nState Aid Decision, all of which was expected to be paid within 12 months. The funds necessary to settle the obligation were held \nin escrow as of September 28, 2024, and restricted from general use.\nCapital Return Program\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does \nnot obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 28, 2024, the Company’s quarterly cash \ndividend was $0.25 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the \nBoard.\nIn May 2024, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $110 billion and raised its quarterly dividend \nfrom $0.24 to $0.25 per share beginning in May 2024. During 2024, the Company repurchased $95.0 billion of its common stock \nand paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.2 billion.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIncome Taxes\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. \n2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which will require the Company \nto disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling \nitems that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid \ndisclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The \nCompany will adopt ASU 2023-09 in its fourth quarter of 2026 using a prospective transition method.\nSegment Reporting\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment \nDisclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which will require the Company to disclose segment expenses that are significant and regularly \nprovided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). In addition, ASU 2023-07 will require the Company to \ndisclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment profit or loss information in assessing segment \nperformance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-07 in its fourth quarter of 2025 using a \nretrospective transition method.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles \n(“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s \nmanagement to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant \nAccounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the \nsignificant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. \nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under \nthe circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s \nuncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and \ninternational tax laws, including the TCJA and the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although \nmanagement believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these \nuncertainties will not be different from that reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing \nfacts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent \nwith management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of \nwhich are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount \nis reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner \ninconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating \nresults.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 26",

      "section_content": "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies \nto manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio \nand term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase \nthe interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative \ninstruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any \nassociated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 28, 2024 and \nSeptember 30, 2023 (dollars in millions):\nInterest Rate\nSensitive Instrument\nHypothetical Interest\nRate Increase\nPotential Impact\n2024\n2023\nInvestment portfolio\n100 basis points, all tenors\nDecline in fair value\n$ \n2,755 \n$ \n3,089 \nTerm debt\n100 basis points, all tenors\nIncrease in annual interest expense\n$ \n139 \n$ \n194 \nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other \nthan the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the \nCompany’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair \nvalues of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use \nderivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company \nmay choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or \nprohibitive cost.\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of \nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair \nvalue, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. \nBased on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $538 \nmillion and $669 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying \nforeign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the \nCompany’s foreign currency derivatives.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 27",

Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of \nthese consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of management \nestimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified \nto conform to the current period’s presentation.\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is \nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which \noccurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2024 and 2022 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal \nyear 2023 spanned 53 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the \nCompany’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nRevenue\nThe Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will \nultimately vest.\nCash Equivalents\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are treated as cash equivalents.\nMarketable Securities\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\nInventories\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings \ncreated by the TCJA.\nLeases\nThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, \ndata center and retail facilities.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 34\nNote 2 – Revenue\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is \ntransferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the \nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s \nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over \ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer \nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer \nincentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the \nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). \nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are \nestablished that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they \nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers \nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation \nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, \nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac \nand iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the \nhardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive \ncertain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any \nrelated discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable \nprices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue \nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which \ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized \non a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For \nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that \nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized \nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the \nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when \ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, \nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party \napplications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the \ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services \nnet sales only the commission it retains.\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):\n2024\n2023\n2022\niPhone\n$ \n201,183 \n$ \n200,583 \n$ \n205,489 \nMac\n \n29,984 \n \n29,357 \n \n40,177 \niPad\n \n26,694 \n \n28,300 \n \n29,292 \nWearables, Home and Accessories\n \n37,005 \n \n39,845 \n \n41,241 \nServices (1)\n \n96,169 \n \n85,200 \n \n78,129 \nTotal net sales\n$ \n391,035 \n$ \n383,285 \n$ \n394,328 \n(1)\nServices net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.\nTotal net sales include $7.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, \n2023, $8.2 billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, and $7.5 \nbillion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 35\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment \nin Note 13, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2024, 2023 and 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone \nrevenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\nAs of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.8 billion and $12.1 billion, \nrespectively. As of September 28, 2024, the Company expects 64% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, \n25% within one-to-two years, 9% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years.\nNote 3 – Earnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2024, 2023 and 2022 (net income in \nmillions and shares in

The September 28, 2024 restricted marketable securities were \ndesignated to settle the Company’s obligation related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 7, “Income Taxes”).\nAs of September  28, 2024, 86% of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities other than mortgage- and asset-\nbacked securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 10% between 5 and 10 years, and 4% greater than 10 years. As of \nSeptember 28, 2024, 14% of the Company’s non-current mortgage- and asset-backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5 \nyears, 9% between 5 and 10 years, and 77% greater than 10 years.\nThe Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The \nCompany classifies marketable debt securities as either current or non-current based on each instrument’s underlying maturity.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. \nHowever, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations \nor the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a \nportion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\nThe Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash \nFlows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other \ninstruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its \nforecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 37\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign \nexchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these \ninstruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 28, 2024, the maximum length of time over which the \nCompany is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 18 \nyears.\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from \ncertain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by \nthe remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest \nrate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 \nwere as follows (in millions):\n2024\n2023\nDerivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts\n$ \n64,069 \n$ \n74,730 \nInterest rate contracts\n$ \n14,575 \n$ \n19,375 \nDerivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts\n$ \n91,493 \n$ \n104,777 \nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 \nwere as follows (in millions):\n2024\n2023\nHedged assets/(liabilities):\nCurrent and non-current marketable securities\n$ \n— \n$ \n14,433 \nCurrent and non-current term debt\n$ \n(13,505) $ \n(18,247) \nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company’s third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 38% and 41% of total trade receivables as of September 28, \n2024 and September  30, 2023, respectively. The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain \ncustomers to limit credit risk.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to \nthese vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these \ncomponents directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, \nthe Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are \nsold by the Company. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of \ntotal vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 44% and 23%.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the \nperiod June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of \nthe tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2 billion.\nFrom time to time, the Company requested approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain \ntaxes paid to other countries. As of September 28, 2024, the adjusted recovery amount of €12.7 billion plus interest of €1.2 billion \nwas held in escrow and restricted from general use. The total balance of the escrow, including net unrealized investment gains, \nwas €14.2 billion or $15.8 billion as of September 28, 2024, of which $2.6 billion was classified as cash and cash equivalents and \n$13.2  billion was classified as current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Although the timing of resolution or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is \nreasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease between approximately $5 billion and $13 billion in \nthe next 12 months, primarily related to intercompany transfer pricing and deemed repatriation tax.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 41\nNote 8 – Leases\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and \nretail space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options, \nsome of which are reasonably certain of exercise.\nPayments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based \non purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating \nleases were $2.0 billion for both 2024 and 2023 and $1.9 billion for 2022. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the \nCompany’s leases were $13.8 billion, $13.9 billion and $14.9 billion for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company made fixed cash payments related to operating leases of $1.9 billion in both 2024 and 2023 and $1.8 billion in \n2022.

RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan generally vest over four years, based on \ncontinued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. All \nRSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights, which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value \nper share as holders of common stock. A maximum of approximately 1.3 billion shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to \n2022 Plan awards at the time the plan was approved on March 4, 2022.\n2014 Employee Stock Plan\nThe Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan, as amended and restated (the “2014 Plan”), is a shareholder-approved plan that \nprovided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2014 Plan permitted the granting of the \nsame types of equity awards with substantially the same terms as the 2022 Plan. The 2014 Plan also permitted the granting of \ncash bonus awards.

The total shares withheld were approximately 31 million, 37 million and 41 \nmillion for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as \ndetermined by the Company’s closing stock price.

The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of supplier \narrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. Future payments under unconditional purchase \nobligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 28, 2024, are as follows (in millions):\n2025\n$ \n3,206 \n2026\n \n2,440 \n2027\n \n1,156 \n2028\n \n3,121 \n2029\n \n633 \nThereafter\n \n670 \nTotal\n$ \n11,226 \nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 45\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that \nhave not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at \nleast a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, \nconcerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain \ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with \nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in \nChina mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\nNote 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Data\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the \nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe \nincludes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong \nand Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable \nsegments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is \nmanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market \ndynamics of each geographic region.\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income.

(the “Company”) as of September 28, 2024 and \nSeptember 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash \nflows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \n“financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the \nCompany at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the \nthree years in the period ended September 28, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) \n(“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission \n(2013 framework) and our report dated November 1, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on \nthe Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are \nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable \nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the \naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to \nerror or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial \nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included \nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included \nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall \npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was \ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are \nmaterial to the financial statements and (2)  involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The \ncommunication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, \nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on \nthe account or disclosure to which it relates.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nDescription of the Matter\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes \nin the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. As of September 28, 2024, the total amount \nof gross unrecognized tax benefits was $22.0 billion, of which $10.8 billion, if recognized, \nwould impact the Company’s effective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax \npositions, the Company uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of \nGAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws.\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than \nnot to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be \ncomplex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal \nrulings.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 48\nHow We Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit\nWe tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls \nover management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be \nsustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions that qualify for \nrecognition, and the related disclosures.\nWe evaluated the Company’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to \nbe sustained and the related measurement of the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for \nrecognition. Our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating \nmanagement’s \nassumptions \nand \nanalysis, \nand, \nas \napplicable, \nthe \nCompany’s \ncommunications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the \nuncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the \ntechnical merits of certain of the Company’s tax positions based on our knowledge of \nrelevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For a certain tax position, \nwe also received an external legal counsel confirmation letter and discussed the matter with \nexternal advisors and the Company’s tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated the \nCompany’s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 7 to the financial \nstatements.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2009.\nSan Jose, California\nNovember 1, 2024\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 49\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission \n(2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. (the “Company”) maintained, in all material respects, effective \ninternal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) \n(“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the related \nconsolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years \nin the period ended September  28, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated November  1, 2024 expressed an \nunqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its \nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual \nReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control \nover financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be \nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and \nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the \naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all \nmaterial respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material \nweakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, \nand performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a \nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the \nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally \naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that \n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions \nof the assets of the company; (2)  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit \npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and \nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the \ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, \nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate \nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nNovember 1, 2024\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 50",

The Company’s \ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: \n(i)\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \ndispositions of the Company’s assets;\n(ii)\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial \nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in \naccordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and\n(iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s \ninternal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can \nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a \ncontrol system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative \nto their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute \nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of \ncontrols in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in \nbusiness conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting \n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the \nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s \nassessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 28, 2024 \nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in \naccordance with GAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit \nreport on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2024, which were \nidentified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the \nExchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over \nfinancial reporting.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 51",

The shareholders may elect a director at any time to fill a \nvacancy not filled by the directors, but any such election by written consent, other than to fill a vacancy created by \nremoval, requires the consent of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon.\nAn amendment of the Bylaws or the Articles may be adopted by the vote of the majority of the outstanding \nshares entitled to vote. Any amendment of the Bylaws specifying or changing a fixed number of directors or the \nmaximum or minimum number or changing from a fixed to a variable board or vice versa may only be adopted by the \nshareholders; provided, however, that an amendment of the Bylaws or the Articles reducing the fixed number or the \nminimum number of directors to less than five cannot be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption are equal to \nmore than 16 2/3% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.\nExhibit 4.1\nAny shareholders’ meeting may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the shares \npresent in person or represented by proxy.\nDividends\nThe holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividends, if any, as may be declared \nfrom time to time by the Company’s Board of Directors in its discretion from funds legally available therefor.\nRight to Receive Liquidation Distributions\nUpon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive \npro rata all assets remaining available for distribution to holders of such shares.\nNo Preemptive or Similar Rights\nCommon Stock has no preemptive or other subscription rights, and there are no conversion rights or \nredemption or sinking fund provisions with respect to such shares of Common Stock.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions of the Articles, Bylaws and California Law\nProvisions of the Articles and Bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential \nchange in control of the Company or change in its management, including transactions in which shareholders might \notherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that its shareholders might otherwise deem to be in their \nbest interests. Among other things, the Articles and Bylaws:\n•\nprovide that, except for a vacancy caused by the removal of a director as provided in the Bylaws, a \nvacancy on the Company’s Board of Directors may be filled by a person selected by a majority of the \nremaining directors then in office, whether or not less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director;\n•\nprovide that shareholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of shareholders or to nominate \ncandidates for election as directors at a meeting of shareholders must provide notice in writing in a \ntimely manner, and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a shareholder’s notice, \nincluding with respect to a shareholder’s notice under Rule 14a-19 of the Exchange Act;\n•\nprovide that a shareholder, or group of up to 20 shareholders, that has owned continuously for at least \nthree years shares of Common Stock representing an aggregate of at least 3% of the Company’s \noutstanding shares of Common Stock, may nominate and include in the Company’s proxy materials \ndirector nominees constituting up to 20% of the Company’s Board of Directors, provided that the \nshareholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the requirements in the Bylaws;\n•\ndo not provide for cumulative voting rights for the election of directors; and\n•\nprovide that special meetings of the shareholders may only be called by (i) the Board of Directors, the \nChair of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer or (ii) one or more holders of shares \nentitled to cast not less than ten percent (10%) of the votes on the record date established pursuant to \nthe Company’s Bylaws, provided that the shareholder(s) satisfy requirements in the Bylaws.\nIn addition, as a California corporation, the Company is subject to the provisions of Section 1203 of the \nCalifornia General Corporation Law, which requires it to provide a fairness opinion to its shareholders in connection \nwith their consideration of any proposed “interested party” reorganization transaction.\nListing\nThe Company’s Common Stock is listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the trading symbol \n“AAPL.”\n2\nDESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES\nThe following description of the Notes is a summary and does not purport to be complete.

provided that any such addition, change or \nelimination (a) shall neither (1) apply to any debt security of any series created prior to the execution of \nsuch supplemental indenture and entitled to the benefit of such provision nor (2) modify the rights of the \nholder of any such debt security with respect to such provision or (b) shall become effective only when \nthere is no debt security described in clause (a)(1) outstanding;\n•\nin the case of the 2018 Indenture, to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of the 2018 \nIndenture in respect of one or more series of debt securities; provided that any such addition, change or \nelimination shall become effective only when there is no outstanding security of any series created prior \nto the execution of such supplemental indenture that is entitled to the benefit of such provision and as to \nwhich such supplemental indenture would apply;\n•\nto cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;\n•\nto change any other provision; provided that the change does not adversely affect the interests of the \nholders of debt securities of, in the case of the 2013 Indenture any series, and in the case of the 2018 \nIndenture, any outstanding series, in any material respect;\n•\nto supplement any of the provisions of the applicable Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to \npermit or facilitate the defeasance and discharge of any series of Notes pursuant to the Indenture; \nprovided that any such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the holders of Notes of such \nseries or any other series of debt securities in any material respect;\n•\nto comply with the rules or regulations of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on \nwhich any of the Notes may be listed or traded; and\n•\nto add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of the applicable Indenture as shall be necessary or \ndesirable in accordance with any amendments to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and in \nthe case of the 2013 Indenture, provided that such action does not adversely affect the rights or \ninterests of any holder of debt securities in any material respect.\nThe holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of any series may, \non behalf of the holders of all Notes of that series, waive compliance by us with certain restrictive provisions of the \nIndentures. The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of a series \nmay, on behalf of the holders of all Notes of that series, waive any past default and its consequences under the \napplicable Indenture with respect to the Notes of that series, except a default (1) in the payment of principal or \npremium, if any, or interest on Notes of that series or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision of the applicable \nIndenture that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each Note of that series. Upon any \nsuch waiver, such default will cease to exist, and any event of default arising therefrom will be deemed to have been \ncured, for every purpose of the Indenture; however, no such waiver will extend to any subsequent or other default or \nevent of default or impair any rights consequent thereon.\n12\nDischarge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance\nWe may discharge certain obligations to holders of the Notes of a series that have not already been \ndelivered to the trustee for cancellation and that either have become due and payable or will become due and \npayable within one year (or scheduled for redemption within one year) by depositing with the trustee, in trust, funds in \nU.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the entire indebtedness including, but not limited to, the principal and \npremium, if any, and interest to the date of such deposit (if due and payable) or to the maturity thereof or the \nredemption date of the Notes of that series, as the case may be. We may direct the trustee to invest such funds in \nU.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of one year or less or in a money market fund that invests solely in short-term \nU.S. Treasury securities.\nThe Indentures provide that we may elect either (1) to defease and be discharged from any and all \nobligations with respect to the Notes of a series (except for, among other things, obligations to register the transfer or \nexchange of the Notes, to replace temporary or mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, to maintain an office or \nagency with respect to the Notes and to hold moneys for payment in trust) (“legal defeasance”) or (2) to be released \nfrom our obligations to comply with the restrictive covenants under the applicable Indenture, and any omission to \ncomply with such obligations will not constitute a default or an event of default with respect to the Notes of a series \nand clauses (3) and (6) under the caption “Events of Default” above will no longer be applied (“covenant \ndefeasance”). Legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, will be conditioned upon, among other \nthings, the irrevocable deposit by us with the trustee, in trust, of an amount in U.S. dollars, or U.S. government \nobligations (as such term is modified below), or both, applicable to the Notes of that series which through the \nscheduled payment of principal and interest in accordance with their terms will provide money in an amount sufficient \nto pay the principal or premium, if any, and interest on the Notes on the scheduled due dates therefor.\nIf we effect covenant defeasance with respect to the Notes of any series, the amount in U.S. dollars, or U.S. \ngovernment obligations (as such term is modified below), or both, on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient, in the \nopinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants, to pay amounts due on the Notes of that series at \nthe time of the stated maturity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the Notes of that series at the time of \nthe acceleration resulting from such event of default. However, we would remain liable to make payment of such \namounts due at the time of acceleration.\nWith respect to the 0.000% 2025 Notes, the 0.875% 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the \n1.375% 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes, the term “U.S. government obligations” shall instead mean (x) any security \nthat is (i) a direct obligation of the German government or (ii) an obligation of a person controlled or supervised by \nand acting as an agency or instrumentality of the German government the payment of which is fully and \nunconditionally guaranteed by the German government or the central bank of the German government, which, in \neither case (x)(i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (y) certificates, depositary \nreceipts or other instruments which evidence a direct ownership interest in obligations described in clause (x)(i) or \n(x)(ii) above or in any specific principal or interest payments due in respect thereof. \nWith respect to the 3.050% 2029 Notes and the 2042 Notes, the term “U.S. government obligations” shall \ninstead mean (x) any security that is (i) a direct obligation of the United Kingdom government or (ii) an obligation of a \nperson controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United Kingdom government the \npayment of which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the United Kingdom government or the central bank of \nthe United Kingdom government, which, in either case (x)(i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the option of the \nissuer thereof, and (y) certificates, depositary receipts or other instruments which evidence a direct ownership interest \nin obligations described in clause (x)(i) or (x)(ii) above or in any specific principal or interest payments due in respect \nthereof. \nWe will be required to deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel that the deposit and related defeasance \nwill not cause the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes of that series to recognize income, gain or loss for \nfederal income tax purposes. If we elect legal defeasance, that opinion of counsel must be based upon a ruling from \nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Service or a change in law to that effect.\nWe may exercise our legal defeasance option notwithstanding our prior exercise of our covenant \ndefeasance option.\n13\nBook-Entry and Settlement\nThe Notes were issued in book-entry form and are represented by global notes deposited with, or on behalf \nof, a common depositary on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream, and are registered in the name of the common \ndepositary or its nominee. Except as described herein, certificated notes will not be issued in exchange for beneficial \ninterests in the global notes.\nCertificated Notes\nSubject to certain conditions, the Notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable for certificated \nnotes in definitive form of like tenor, in minimum denominations of €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of \n€1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the 0.000% 2025 Notes, the 0.875% 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 \nNotes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes, and in minimum denominations of £100,000 principal amount \nand integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the 3.050% 2029 Notes and the 2042 Notes, if: \n1.\nthe common depositary notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary or if the \ncommon depositary ceases to be eligible under the applicable Indenture and we do not appoint a \nsuccessor depository within 90 days;\n2. \nwe determine that the Notes will no longer be represented by global securities and execute and deliver \nto the trustee an order to that effect; or\n3. \nan event of default with respect to the Notes will have occurred and be continuing. \nAny Note that is exchangeable as above is exchangeable for certificated notes issuable in authorized \ndenominations and registered in such names as the common depositary shall direct. Subject to the foregoing, a \nglobal note is not exchangeable, except for a global note of the same aggregate denomination to be registered in the \nname of the common depositary or its nominee. \nThe Trustee for the Notes\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. is the trustee under the Indentures. We have \ncommercial deposits and custodial arrangements with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. and its \naffiliates (“BNYM”). We may enter into similar or other banking relationships with BNYM in the future in the normal \ncourse of business. In addition, BNYM acts as trustee and as paying agent with respect to other debt securities \nissued by us, and may do so for future issuances of debt securities by us as well.\n14\nAPPLE INC.\n2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PLAN\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT\nNOTICE OF GRANT\nName:  \n \n \n \n(the “Participant”)\nEmployee ID: \nGrant Number: \nNo. of Units Subject to Award: \nAward Date: \n \n \n \n(the “Award Date”)\nVesting Commencement Date: \n(the “Vesting Commencement Date”)\nVesting Schedule: \nThis restricted stock unit award (the “Award”) is granted under and governed by the terms and \nconditions of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan and the Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock \nUnit Award, which are incorporated herein by reference.\nYou do not have to accept the Award. If you wish to decline your Award, you should promptly \nnotify Apple Inc.’s Stock Plan Group of your decision at peoplesupport@apple.com. If you do not provide \nsuch notification by the last day of the calendar month prior to the first Vesting Date, you will be deemed \nto have accepted your Award on the terms and conditions set forth herein.\nExhibit 10.19\nAPPLE INC.\n2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PLAN\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD\n1.\nGeneral.  These Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award (these “Terms”) \napply to a particular restricted stock unit award (the “Award”) granted by Apple Inc., a California \ncorporation (the “Company”), and are incorporated by reference in the Notice of Grant (the “Grant \nNotice”) corresponding to that particular grant. The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is \nreferred to as the “Participant.” The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is \nreferred to as the “Award Date.” The Award was granted under and is subject to the provisions of the \nApple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the “Plan”). Capitalized terms are \ndefined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the \nParticipant in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be \npaid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these Terms are collectively referred to as the “Award \nAgreement” applicable to the Award.\n2.\nRSUs.  As used herein, the term “RSU” shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement \nwhich is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to be equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes \nof the Plan and this Award Agreement. RSUs shall be used solely as a device for the determination of the \nShares eventually to be issued to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. \nThe RSUs are an unfunded and unsecured right to receive Shares and shall not be treated as property or \nas a trust fund of any kind.\n3.\nVesting.  Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become \nnonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice. (Each vesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred \nto herein as a “Vesting Date.”) Unless and until the Company elects to issue fractional Shares in \nsettlement of a vested RSU, any fractional RSUs that vest on a Vesting Date shall be carried forward and \nvest when such combined fractional RSUs result in a full RSU and any fractional RSU that is not carried \nforward as a result of a termination of the Award prior to the next subsequent Vesting Date shall be \nforfeited.\n4.\nContinuance of Employment.  Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 \nbelow, vesting of the Award requires continued active employment or service through each applicable \nVesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and the rights and \nbenefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the period between the \nAward Date and the first Vesting Date or between subsequent Vesting Dates, even if a substantial \nportion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this \nAward Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of absence (other \nthan a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of \nabsence, in each case as approved by the Company, in its sole discretion. The vesting of the Award shall \nbe tolled beginning on the thirty-first (31st) day of a personal leave of absence.\nNothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service \ncommitment by the Company, affects the Participant’s status as an employee at will who is subject to \ntermination with or without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain employed by or in \nservice to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any \nSubsidiary at any time to terminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Company or \nany Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant’s other compensation or benefits. Nothing in this \nSection 4, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant \nwithout the Participant’s consent thereto. \n1\n5.\nDividend and Voting Rights.\n(a)\nLimitations on Rights Associated with RSUs.  The Participant shall have no \nrights as a shareholder of the Company, no dividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) \nwith respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to the RSUs or any Shares \nunderlying or issuable in respect of such RSUs until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record \nby the Participant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the \nrecord date is prior to the date of issuance of Shares as reflected in the book entry evidencing such \nShares.\n(b)\nDividend Equivalent Rights.  As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary \ncash dividend on its Shares, the Company shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the \nper share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Shares on such date, multiplied by (ii)  the total \nnumber of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to the \nAward that are outstanding on the record date for that dividend (a “Dividend Equivalent Right”). Any \nDividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be \nsubject to the same vesting, payment and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the original RSUs to \nwhich they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided, however, that the \namount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. No crediting of Dividend \nEquivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any RSUs which, as of the \nrecord date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to \nSection 8.\n6.\nRestrictions on Transfer.  Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, \nthe Dividend Equivalent Rights and any interest therein or amount or Shares issued in respect thereof \nshall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, alienated or encumbered, \neither voluntarily or involuntarily.\n7.\nTiming and Manner of Settlement of RSUs.  On or as soon as administratively practical \nfollowing each vesting event pursuant to Section 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and \none-half (2 ½) months after such vesting event), the Company shall deliver to the Participant a number of \nShares equal to the number of RSUs subject to the Award that vest on such vesting event, less Tax-\nRelated Items. The Company’s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise settle RSUs is subject to the \ncondition precedent that the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any Shares with \nrespect to the vested RSUs deliver to the Company any representations or other documents or \nassurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights \nwith respect to any RSUs that are settled or that are forfeited pursuant to Section 8.\n8.\nEffect of Termination of Service.  Except as expressly provided in Section 4 or this \nSection 8, the Participant’s RSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall terminate to \nthe extent such RSUs have not become vested prior to the date of the Participant’s Termination of \nService, meaning the first date the Participant is no longer employed by or providing services to the \nCompany or one of its Subsidiaries (the “Severance Date”), regardless of the reason for the Participant’s \nTermination of Service, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily, or whether the \nParticipant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period prior to a Vesting Date \nand the Participant will have no right to the terminated RSUs, any underlying Shares or any cash \nequivalent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Participant’s Termination of Service is due to \nthe Participant’s Disability at a time when RSUs remain unvested under the Award, (a) the Award shall \nvest on the Severance Date with respect to the number of RSUs (as well as the related Dividend \nEquivalent Rights) determined by multiplying (i)  the number of then-outstanding and unvested RSUs \nsubject to the Award that would have otherwise vested pursuant to Section 3 on the next Vesting Date \nfollowing the Severance Date but for such Termination of Service, by (ii)  a fraction, the numerator of \nwhich shall be the number of days that have elapsed between the Vesting Date that immediately \npreceded the Severance Date (or, in the case of a Termination of Service prior to the initial Vesting Date, \n2\nthe Vesting Commencement Date) and the Severance Date, and the denominator of which shall be the \nnumber of days between the Vesting Date that immediately preceded the Severance Date (or, in the case \nof a Termination of Service prior to the initial Vesting Date, the Vesting Commencement Date) and the \nnext Vesting Date following the Severance Date that would have occurred but for such Termination of \nService; and (b) any RSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) that are not vested after \ngiving effect to the foregoing clause (a) shall terminate on the Severance Date. Further, in the event the \nParticipant’s Termination of Service is due to the Participant’s death, any unvested RSUs shall be fully \nvested as of the Severance Date, and any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited to the Participant shall be \npaid. If any unvested RSUs are terminated hereunder, such RSUs (as well as the related Dividend \nEquivalent Rights) shall automatically terminate and be canceled as of the applicable Severance Date \nwithout payment of any consideration by the Company and without any other action by the Participant or \nthe Participant’s beneficiary or personal representative, as the case may be.\n9.\nRecoupment.  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Award and any Shares or \nother amount or property that may be issued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any \nconsideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of any such Shares or \nproperty, shall be subject to any recoupment, “clawback” or similar provisions of Applicable Laws relevant \nto the Company’s Shares and any recoupment, “clawback” or similar policy maintained by the Company \nfrom time to time. In addition, the Company may require the Participant to deliver or otherwise repay to \nthe Company the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be issued, delivered or \npaid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or \nother disposition of any such Shares or property, if the Company reasonably determines that one or more \nof the following has occurred:\n(a)\nduring the period of the Participant’s employment or service with the Company or \nany of its Subsidiaries (the “Employment Period”), the Participant has committed a felony (under the \nlaws of the United States or any relevant state, or a similar crime or offense under the applicable laws of \nany relevant foreign jurisdiction);\n(b)\nduring the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has \ncommitted or engaged in a breach of confidentiality, or an unauthorized disclosure or use of inside \ninformation, customer lists, trade secrets or other confidential information of the Company or any of its \nSubsidiaries;\n(c)\nduring the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has \ncommitted or engaged in an act of theft, embezzlement or fraud, or materially breached any agreement to \nwhich the Participant is a party with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.\nFor purposes of the foregoing, the Participant expressly and explicitly authorizes the Company to \nissue instructions, on the Participant’s behalf, to any brokerage firm or third party administrator holding \nthe Participant’s Shares and/or other amounts acquired under the Plan to re-convey, transfer, or \notherwise return such Shares and/or other amounts to the Company. By accepting this Award, the \nParticipant further agrees to comply with any request or demand for repayment by the Company in order \nto comply with such policies or Applicable Laws. To the extent that the terms of this Agreement and any \nCompany recoupment policy conflict, the terms of the recoupment policy shall prevail. This Section 9 is \nnot the Company’s exclusive remedy with respect to such matters.\n10.\nAdjustments Upon Specified Events.  Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to \nthe Company’s stock contemplated by Section 11 of the Plan (including, without limitation, an \nextraordinary cash dividend on such stock), the Committee shall make adjustments in accordance with \nsuch section in the number of RSUs then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be \nissued in respect of the Award. No such adjustment shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash \ndividend for which Dividend Equivalent Rights are credited pursuant to Section 5(b).\n3\n11.\nResponsibility for Taxes.  The Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action \nthe Company and/or the Participant’s employer (“Employer”) take with respect to any Tax-Related Items, \nthe ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant’s responsibility and may \nexceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further \nacknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i)  make no representations or undertakings \nregarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, including \nthe grant of the RSUs, the vesting of the RSUs, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any \nShares acquired at vesting, and the receipt of any dividends and/or Dividend Equivalent Rights; and \n(ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the \nAward to reduce or eliminate the Participant’s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax \nresult. Further, if the Participant is or becomes subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Participant \nacknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be \nrequired to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.\nPrior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or \nmake arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In \nthis regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at \ntheir discretion and pursuant to such procedures as they may specify from time to time, to satisfy any \napplicable withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the \nfollowing:\n(a) \nwithholding from any wages or other cash compensation payable to the \nParticipant by the Company and/or the Employer;\n(b) \nwithholding otherwise deliverable Shares and/or from otherwise payable \nDividend Equivalent Rights to be issued or paid upon vesting/settlement of the Award;\n(c)  \narranging for the sale of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant (on the \nParticipant’s behalf and at the Participant’s direction pursuant to this authorization), including selling \nShares as part of a block trade with other Participants in the Plan;\n(d) \nwithholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon vesting/\nsettlement of the Award; or\n(e) \nany other method of withholding determined by the Company to be permitted \nunder the Plan and, to the extent required by Applicable Law or under the Plan, approved by the \nCommittee.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is an officer of the Company who is subject to \nSection 16 of the Exchange Act, then the Company must satisfy any withholding obligations arising upon \nthe occurrence of a taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, by  withholding Shares otherwise \ndeliverable or an amount otherwise payable upon settlement of Dividend Equivalent Rights pursuant to \nmethod (b), unless the Board or the Committee determines in its discretion to satisfy the obligation for \nTax-Related Items by one or a combination of methods (a), (b), (c), and (d) above.\n \nThe Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory \nwithholding amounts or other withholding rates, including maximum rates applicable in the Participant’s \njurisdiction(s). If the maximum rate is used, any over-withheld amount may be refunded to the Participant \nin cash by the Company or Employer (with no entitlement to the Share equivalent) or if not refunded, the \nParticipant may seek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, the \nParticipant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items directly to the applicable tax authority or \nto the Company or Employer. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number \nof Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full \nnumber of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back \n4\nsolely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver to \nthe Participant any Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with the \nParticipant’s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.\n12.\nElectronic Delivery and Acceptance.  The Company may, in its sole discretion, deliver \nany documents related to the Award by electronic means or request the Participant’s consent to \nparticipate in the Plan by electronic means. The Participant hereby consents to receive all applicable \ndocumentation by electronic delivery and to participate in the Plan through an on-line or voice activated \nsystem established and maintained by the Company or a third party vendor designated by the Company.\n13.\nData Privacy.  By participating in the Plan, the Participant acknowledges and consents to \nthe collection, use, processing and transfer of personal data as described in this Section 13. The \nCompany, its related entities, and the Employer hold certain personal information about the Participant, \nincluding the Participant’s name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, \nsocial security number or other employee identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or \ndirectorships held in the Company, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to Shares or equivalent \nbenefits awarded, canceled, purchased, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Participant’s favor, for the \npurpose of managing and administering the Plan (“Data”). The Company and its related entities may \ntransfer Data amongst themselves as necessary for the purpose of implementation, administration, and \nmanagement of the Participant’s participation in the Plan, and the Company and its related entities may \neach further transfer Data to any third parties assisting the Company or any such related entity in the \nimplementation, administration, and management of the Plan.

If you wish to decline your Award, you should promptly \nnotify Apple Inc.’s Stock Plan Group of your decision at peoplesupport@apple.com. If you do not provide \nsuch notification by the last day of the calendar month prior to the Vesting Date, you will be deemed to \nhave accepted your Award on the terms and conditions set forth herein.\nExhibit 10.20\nAPPLE INC.\n2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PLAN\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD\nPERFORMANCE AWARD\n1.\nGeneral.  These Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award - Performance \nAward (these “Terms”) apply to a particular restricted stock unit award (the “Award”) granted by Apple \nInc., a California corporation (the “Company”), and are incorporated by reference in the Notice of Grant \n(the “Grant Notice”) corresponding to that particular grant. The recipient of the Award identified in the \nGrant Notice is referred to as the “Participant.” The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the \nGrant Notice is referred to as the “Award Date.” The Award was granted under and is subject to the \nprovisions of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the “Plan”). \nCapitalized terms are defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been \ngranted to the Participant in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise \npayable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these Terms (including Exhibit A hereto, \nincorporated herein by this reference) are collectively referred to as the “Award Agreement” applicable to \nthe Award.\n2.\nRSUs.  As used herein, the term “RSU” shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement \nwhich is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to be equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes \nof the Plan and this Award Agreement. The RSUs shall be used solely as a device for the determination \nof the Shares eventually to be issued to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award \nAgreement. The RSUs are an unfunded and unsecured right to receive Shares and shall not be treated \nas property or as a trust fund of any kind.\n3.\nVesting.  Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become \nnonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice and Exhibit A hereto. (The vesting date set forth in the \nGrant Notice is referred to herein as a “Vesting Date”).\n4.\nContinuance of Employment.  Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 \nbelow, vesting of the Award requires continued active employment or service through the Vesting Date as \na condition to the vesting of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Award Agreement. \nEmployment or service for only a portion of the performance or vesting period, even if a substantial \nportion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this \nAward Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of absence (other \nthan a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of \nabsence, in each case as approved by the Company, in its sole discretion. The vesting of the Award shall \nbe tolled beginning on the thirty-first (31st) day of a personal leave of absence.\nNothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service \ncommitment by the Company, affects the Participant’s status as an employee at will who is subject to \ntermination with or without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain employed by or in \nservice to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any \nSubsidiary at any time to terminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Company or \nany Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant’s other compensation or benefits. Nothing in this \nSection 4, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant \nwithout the Participant’s consent thereto.\n1\n5.\nDividend and Voting Rights.\n(a)\nLimitations on Rights Associated with RSUs. The Participant shall have no \nrights as a shareholder of the Company, no dividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) \nwith respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to the RSUs or any Shares \nunderlying or issuable in respect of such RSUs until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record \nby the Participant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the \nrecord date is prior to the date of issuance of the Shares as reflected in the book entry evidencing such \nShares.\n(b) \nDividend Equivalent Rights.  As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary \ncash dividend on its Shares, the Company shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the \nper share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Shares on such date, multiplied by (ii) the total target \nnumber of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to the \nAward that are outstanding on the record date for that dividend (a “Dividend Equivalent Right”). Any \nDividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be \nsubject to the same vesting, payment and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the original RSUs to \nwhich they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided, however, that the \namount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. For purposes of clarity, the \npercentage of the Dividend Equivalent Rights that are paid will correspond to the percentage of the total \ntarget number of RSUs that vest on the Vesting Date, after giving effect to Exhibit A. No crediting of \nDividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any RSUs which, \nas of the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated \npursuant to Section 8 or Exhibit A.\n6.\nRestrictions on Transfer.  Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, \nthe Dividend Equivalent Rights and any interest therein or amount or Shares issued in respect thereof \nshall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, alienated or encumbered, \neither voluntarily or involuntarily.\n7.\nTiming and Manner of Settlement of RSUs.  On or as soon as administratively practical \nfollowing the Vesting Date pursuant to Section 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and \none-half (2 ½) months after such Vesting Date), the Company shall deliver to the Participant a number of \nShares equal to the number of RSUs subject to the Award that vest on the Vesting Date, less Tax-\nRelated Items. The Company’s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise settle vested RSUs is subject to \nthe condition precedent that the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any Shares \nwith respect to the vested RSUs deliver to the Company any representations or other documents or \nassurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights \nwith respect to any RSUs that are settled or that are forfeited pursuant to Section 8.\n8.\nEffect of Termination of Service.  Except as expressly provided in Section 4 or this \nSection 8, the Participant’s RSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall terminate to \nthe extent such RSUs have not become vested prior to the date of the Participant’s Termination of \nService, meaning the first date the Participant is no longer employed by or providing services to the \nCompany or one of its Subsidiaries (the “Severance Date”), regardless of the reason for the Participant’s \nTermination of Service, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily or whether the \nParticipant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period prior to a Vesting Date \nand the Participant will have no right to the terminated RSUs, any underlying Shares or any cash \nequivalent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Participant’s Termination of Service is due to \nthe Participant’s death or Disability and the Severance Date occurs prior to the Vesting Date, on the \nVesting Date the Award shall vest with respect to a number of RSUs (as well as the related Dividend \nEquivalent Rights) determined by multiplying (i) the RSUs subject to the Award that would have otherwise \nvested pursuant to the Award on such Vesting Date but for the Termination of Service and to the extent \nthe applicable performance-based vesting requirement is satisfied, by (ii)  the Severance Fraction \n2\n(determined as set forth below). Any RSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) that are \nunvested on the Severance Date and that are not eligible to vest on the Vesting Date following the \nSeverance Date pursuant to the preceding sentence shall terminate as of the Severance Date, and any \nRSUs that remain outstanding and unvested after giving effect to the preceding sentence shall terminate \nas of the Vesting Date. The “Severance Fraction” means a fraction, the numerator of which shall be \ndetermined by subtracting the number of days remaining in the Performance Period on the Severance \nDate from the total number of days in the Performance Period, and the denominator of which shall be the \ntotal number of days in the Performance Period. If any unvested RSUs are terminated pursuant to this \nAward Agreement, such RSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall automatically \nterminate and be canceled as of the applicable Severance Date (or, to the extent that any RSUs remain \noutstanding following the Severance Date by reason of this Section 8, but the applicable performance-\nbased vesting conditions are not satisfied, such RSUs shall automatically terminate and be canceled as of \nthe Vesting Date, as provided in Exhibit A) without payment of any consideration by the Company and \nwithout any other action by the Participant, or the Participant’s beneficiary or personal representative, as \nthe case may be.\n9.\nRecoupment.  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Award and any Shares or \nother amount or property that may be issued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any \nconsideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of any such Shares or \nproperty, shall be subject to any recoupment, “clawback” or similar provisions of Applicable Laws relevant \nto the Company’s Shares and any recoupment, “clawback” or similar policy maintained by the Company \nfrom time to time. In addition, the Company may require the Participant to deliver or otherwise repay to \nthe Company the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be issued, delivered or \npaid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or \nother disposition of any such Shares or property, if the Company reasonably determines that one or more \nof the following has occurred:\n(a)\nduring the period of the Participant’s employment or service with the Company or \nany of its Subsidiaries (the “Employment Period”), the Participant has committed a felony (under the \nlaws of the United States or any relevant state, or a similar crime or offense under the applicable laws of \nany relevant foreign jurisdiction);\n(b)\nduring the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has \ncommitted or engaged in a breach of confidentiality, or an unauthorized disclosure or use of inside \ninformation, customer lists, trade secrets or other confidential information of the Company or any of its \nSubsidiaries;\n(c)\nduring the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has \ncommitted or engaged in an act of theft, embezzlement or fraud, or materially breached any agreement to \nwhich the Participant is a party with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.\nFor purposes of the foregoing, the Participant expressly and explicitly authorizes the Company to \nissue instructions, on the Participant’s behalf, to any brokerage firm and/or third party administrator \nholding the Participant’s Shares and/or other amounts acquired under the Plan to re-convey, transfer or \notherwise return such Shares and/or other amounts to the Company. By accepting this Award, the \nParticipant further agrees to comply with any request or demand for repayment by the Company in order \nto comply with such policies or Applicable Laws. To the extent that the terms of this Agreement and any \nCompany recoupment policy conflict, the terms of the recoupment policy shall prevail. This Section 9 is \nnot the Company’s exclusive remedy with respect to such matters.\n10.\nAdjustments Upon Specified Events.  Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to \nthe Company’s stock contemplated by Section 11 of the Plan (including, without limitation, an \nextraordinary cash dividend on such stock), the Committee shall make adjustments in accordance with \nsuch section in the number of RSUs then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be \n3\nissued in respect of the Award. No such adjustment shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash \ndividend for which Dividend Equivalent Rights are credited pursuant to Section 5(b).\n11.\nResponsibility for Taxes.  The Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action \nthe Company and/or the Participant’s employer (“Employer”) take with respect to any Tax-Related Items, \nthe ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant’s responsibility and may \nexceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further \nacknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i)  make no representations or undertakings \nregarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, including \nthe grant of the RSUs, the vesting of the RSUs, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any \nShares acquired at vesting and the receipt of any dividends and/or Dividend Equivalent Rights; and (ii) do \nnot commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Award \nto reduce or eliminate the Participant’s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. \nFurther, if the Participant is or becomes subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Participant \nacknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be \nrequired to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.\nPrior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or \nmake arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In \nthis regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at \ntheir discretion and pursuant to such procedures as they may specify from time to time, to satisfy any \napplicable withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the \nfollowing:\n(a) \nwithholding from any wages or other cash compensation payable to the \nParticipant by the Company and/or the Employer;\n(b) \nwithholding otherwise deliverable Shares and/or from otherwise payable \nDividend Equivalent Rights to be issued or paid upon vesting/settlement of the Award;\n(c)  \narranging for the sale of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant (on the \nParticipant’s behalf and at the Participant’s direction pursuant to this authorization), including selling \nShares as part of a block trade with other Participants in the Plan;\n(d) \nwithholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon vesting/\nsettlement of the Award; or\n(e) \nany other method of withholding determined by the Company to be permitted \nunder the Plan and, to the extent required by Applicable Law or under the Plan, approved by the \nCommittee.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is an officer of the Company who is subject to \nSection 16 of the Exchange Act, then the Company must satisfy any withholding obligations arising upon \nthe occurrence of a taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, by  withholding Shares otherwise \ndeliverable or an amount otherwise payable upon settlement of Dividend Equivalent Rights pursuant to \nmethod (b), unless the Board or the Committee determines in its discretion to satisfy the obligation for \nTax-Related Items by one or a combination of methods (a), (b), (c), and (d) above.\n \nThe Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory \nwithholding amounts or other withholding rates, including maximum rates applicable in the Participant's \njurisdictions(s). If the maximum rate is used, any over-withheld amount may be refunded to the Participant \nin cash by the Company or Employer (with no entitlement to the Share equivalent) or if not refunded, the \nParticipant may seek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, the \nParticipant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items directly to the applicable tax authority or \n4\nto the Company or Employer. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number \nof Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full \nnumber of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back \nsolely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver to \nthe Participant any Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with the \nParticipant’s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.\n12.\nElectronic Delivery and Acceptance.  The Company may, in its sole discretion, deliver \nany documents related to the Award by electronic means or request the Participant’s consent to \nparticipate in the Plan by electronic means. The Participant hereby consents to receive all applicable \ndocumentation by electronic delivery and to participate in the Plan through an on-line or voice activated \nsystem established and maintained by the Company or a third party vendor designated by the Company.\n13.\nData Privacy.  By participating in the Plan, the Participant acknowledges and consents to \nthe collection, use, processing and transfer of personal data as described in this Section 13. The \nCompany, its related entities, and the Employer hold certain personal information about the Participant, \nincluding the Participant’s name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, \nsocial security number or other employee identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or \ndirectorships held in the Company, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to Shares or equivalent \nbenefits awarded, canceled, purchased, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Participant’s favor, for the \npurpose of managing and administering the Plan (“Data”). The Company and its related entities may \ntransfer Data amongst themselves as necessary for the purpose of implementation, administration and \nmanagement of the Participant’s participation in the Plan, and the Company and its related entities may \neach further transfer Data to any third parties assisting the Company or any such related entity in the \nimplementation, administration and management of the Plan. The Participant acknowledges that the \ntransferors and transferees of such Data may be located anywhere in the world and hereby authorizes \neach of them to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the \npurposes of implementing, administering and managing the Participant’s participation in the Plan, \nincluding any transfer of such Data as may be required for the administration of the Plan and/or the \nsubsequent holding of Shares on the Participant’s behalf to a broker or to other third party with whom the \nParticipant may elect to deposit any Shares acquired under the Plan (whether pursuant to the Award or \notherwise).\n14.\nNotices.  Any notice to be given under the terms of this Award Agreement shall be in \nwriting and addressed to the Company at its principal office to the attention of the Secretary, and to the \nParticipant at the Participant’s last address reflected on the Company’s records, or at such other address \nas either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other.

This Award Agreement and the Plan together constitute the entire \nagreement and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, written or oral, of the parties hereto \nwith respect to the subject matter hereof. The Plan and this Award Agreement may be amended pursuant \nto Section  15 of the Plan. Such amendment must be in writing and signed by the Company.

The Company reserves the right to impose other \nrequirements on the Participant’s participation in the Plan, on the RSUs and on any Shares acquired \nunder the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or \nadministrative reasons, and to require the Participant to sign any additional agreements or undertakings \nthat may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.\n* * * * *\n6\nPERFORMANCE AWARD\nEXHIBIT A\nPERFORMANCE VESTING REQUIREMENTS\nThe RSUs (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) subject to the Award that will vest on the \nVesting Date will be determined based on the Company’s relative total shareholder return (“TSR”) \nPercentile for the Performance Period.\nThe percentage of the RSUs (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) that vest on the Vesting \nDate will be determined as follows:\n•\nIf the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [     ] ([     ]) \npercentile or greater, [     ] ([     ]%) of the target RSUs will vest on the Vesting Date.\n•\nIf the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [     ] ([     ]) \npercentile, [     ] ([     ]%) of the target RSUs will vest on the Vesting Date.\n•\nIf the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [     ] ([     ]) \npercentile, [     ] ([     ]%) of the target RSUs will vest on the Vesting Date.\n•\nIf the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is below the [     ]    ([     ]) \npercentile, [     ] ([     ]%) of the RSUs will vest on the Vesting Date.\nFor TSR Percentile performance for the Performance Period between the levels indicated above, \nthe portion of the RSUs that will vest on the Vesting Date will be determined on a straight-line basis (i.e., \nlinearly interpolated) between the two nearest vesting percentages indicated above.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company’s TSR for the Performance Period is negative, in \nno event shall more than one hundred percent (100%) of the target RSUs vest.\nThe number of RSUs that vest on the Vesting Date will be rounded to the nearest whole unit, and \nthe balance of the RSUs will not vest and will terminate on that Vesting Date.\n \nFor purposes of the Award, the following definitions will apply:\n•\n“TSR Percentile” means the percentile ranking of the Company’s TSR among the TSRs \nfor the Comparison Group members for the Performance Period. In determining the \nCompany’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period, in the event that the Company’s \nTSR for the Performance Period is equal to the TSR(s) of one or more other Comparison \nGroup members for that same period, the Company’s TSR Percentile ranking will be \ndetermined by ranking the Company’s TSR for that period as being greater than such \nother Comparison Group members.\n•\n“Comparison Group” means the Company and each other company included in the \nStandard & Poor’s 500 Index on the first day of the Performance Period and, except as \nprovided below, the common stock (or similar equity security) of which continues to be \nlisted or traded on a national securities exchange through the last trading day of the \nPerformance Period. In the event a member of the Comparison Group files for \nbankruptcy or liquidates due to an insolvency, such company shall continue to be treated \nas a Comparison Group member, and such company’s Ending Price will be treated as $0 \nif the common stock (or similar equity security) of such company is no longer listed or \nA-1\ntraded on a national securities exchange on the last trading day of the Performance \nPeriod. In the event of a formation of a new parent company by a Comparison Group \nmember, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of which consist immediately after \nthe transaction of the equity interests in the original Comparison Group member or the \nassets and liabilities of such Comparison Group member immediately prior to the \ntransaction, such new parent company shall be substituted for the Comparison Group \nmember to the extent (and for such period of time) as its common stock (or similar equity \nsecurities) are listed or traded on a national securities exchange but the common stock \n(or similar equity securities) of the original Comparison Group member are not. In the \nevent of a merger or other business combination of two Comparison Group members \n(including, without limitation, the acquisition of one Comparison Group member, or all or \nsubstantially all of its assets, by another Comparison Group member), the surviving, \nresulting or successor entity, as the case may be, shall continue to be treated as a \nmember of the Comparison Group, provided that the common stock (or similar equity \nsecurity) of such entity is listed or traded on a national securities exchange through the \nlast trading day of the Performance Period. With respect to the preceding two sentences, \nthe applicable stock prices shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted to the extent (if \nany) necessary to preserve the intended incentives of the awards and mitigate the impact \nof the transaction.\n•\n“TSR” shall be determined with respect to the Company and any other Comparison \nGroup member by dividing: (a) the sum of (i) the difference obtained by subtracting the \napplicable Beginning Price from the applicable Ending Price and (ii)  all dividends and \nother distributions during the Performance Period by (b) the applicable Beginning Price. \nAny non-cash distributions shall be valued at fair market value. For the purpose of \ndetermining TSR, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined by \ntreating them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at the closing market price on \nthe date of distribution.\n•\n“Beginning Price” means, with respect to the Company and any other Comparison \nGroup member, the average of the closing market prices of such company’s common \nstock on the principal exchange on which such stock is traded for the twenty (20) \nconsecutive trading days beginning with the first trading day of the Performance Period. \nFor the purpose of determining Beginning Price, the value of dividends and other \ndistributions shall be determined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of \nstock at the closing market price on the date of distribution.\n•\n“Ending Price” means, with respect to the Company and any other Comparison Group \nmember, the average of the closing market prices of such company’s common stock on \nthe principal exchange on which such stock is traded for the twenty (20) consecutive \ntrading days ending on the last trading day of the Performance Period. For the purpose of \ndetermining Ending Price, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be \ndetermined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at the closing \nmarket price on the date of distribution.\n \nWith respect to the computation of TSR, Beginning Price, and Ending Price, there shall also be \nan equitable and proportionate adjustment to the extent (if any) necessary to preserve the intended \nincentives of the awards and mitigate the impact of any stock split, stock dividend or reverse stock split \noccurring during the Performance Period (or during the applicable twenty (20)-day period in determining \nBeginning Price or Ending Price, as the case may be).\n \nIn the event of any ambiguity or discrepancy, the determination of the Committee shall be final \nand binding.\n* * * * *\nA-2\nAPPLE INC.\n2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PLAN\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT\nNOTICE OF GRANT\nName:  \n \n \n \n(the “Participant”)\nEmployee ID: \nGrant Number: \nNo. of Units Subject to Award: \nAward Date: \n \n \n \n(the “Award Date”)\nVesting Commencement Date: \n(the “Vesting Commencement Date”)\nVesting Schedule: \nThis restricted stock unit award (the “Award”) is granted under and governed by the terms and \nconditions of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan and the Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock \nUnit Award, which are incorporated herein by reference.\nYou do not have to accept the Award.

These Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award (these “Terms”) \napply to a particular restricted stock unit award (the “Award”) granted by Apple Inc., a California \ncorporation (the “Company”), and are incorporated by reference in the Notice of Grant (the “Grant \nNotice”) corresponding to that particular grant.  The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is \nreferred to as the “Participant.”  The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice \nis referred to as the “Award Date.” The Award was granted under and is subject to the provisions of the \nApple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the “Plan”).  Capitalized terms are \ndefined in the Plan if not defined herein.  The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the \nParticipant in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be \npaid to the Participant.  The Grant Notice and these Terms are collectively referred to as the “Award \nAgreement” applicable to the Award.\n2.\nRSUs.  As used herein, the term “RSU” shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement \nwhich is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to be equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes \nof the Plan and this Award Agreement.  RSUs shall be used solely as a device for the determination of \nthe Shares eventually to be issued to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award \nAgreement.  The RSUs are an unfunded and unsecured right to receive Shares and shall not be treated \nas property or as a trust fund of any kind.\n3.\nVesting.  Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become \nnonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice.  (Each vesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred \nto herein as a “Vesting Date.”)  Unless and until the Company elects to issue fractional Shares in \nsettlement of a vested RSU, any fractional RSUs that vest on a Vesting Date shall be carried forward and \nvest when such combined fractional RSUs result in a full RSU and any fractional RSU that is not carried \nforward as a result of a termination of the Award prior to the next subsequent Vesting Date shall be \nforfeited.\n4.\nContinuance of Employment.  Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 \nbelow, vesting of the Award requires continued active employment or service through each applicable \nVesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and the rights and \nbenefits under this Award Agreement.  Employment or service for only a portion of the period between the \nAward Date and the first Vesting Date, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any \nproportionate vesting of the Award.  For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include \n(a) the duration of an approved leave of absence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the \nfirst thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as approved by the \nCompany, in its sole discretion. The vesting of the Award shall be tolled beginning on the thirty-first (31st) \nday of a personal leave of absence.\nNothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service \ncommitment by the Company, affects the Participant’s status as an employee at will who is subject to \ntermination with or without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain employed by or in \nservice to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any \nSubsidiary at any time to terminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Company or \nany Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant’s other compensation or benefits. Nothing in this \nSection 4, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant \nwithout the Participant’s consent thereto.\n1\n5.\nDividend and Voting Rights.\n(a)\nLimitations on Rights Associated with RSUs.  The Participant shall have no \nrights as a shareholder of the Company, no dividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) \nwith respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to the RSUs or any Shares \nunderlying or issuable in respect of such RSUs until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record \nby the Participant.  No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the \nrecord date is prior to the date of issuance of the Shares as reflected in the book entry evidencing such \nShares.\n(b)\nDividend Equivalent Rights.  As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary \ncash dividend on its Shares, the Company shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the \nper share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Shares on such date, multiplied by (ii)  the total \nnumber of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to the \nAward that are outstanding on the record date for that dividend (a “Dividend Equivalent Right”). Any \nDividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be \nsubject to the same vesting, payment and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the original RSUs to \nwhich they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided, however, that the \namount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash.  No crediting of Dividend \nEquivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any RSUs which, as of the \nrecord date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to \nSection 8.\n6.\nRestrictions on Transfer.  Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, \nthe Dividend Equivalent Rights and any interest therein or amount or Shares issued in respect thereof \nshall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, alienated or encumbered, \neither voluntarily or involuntarily.\n7.\nTiming and Manner of Settlement of RSUs.  On or as soon as administratively practical \nfollowing each Vesting Date determined pursuant to Sections 3 or 8 or following the Participant’s death as \nspecified in Section 8(d) (and in all events not later than two and one-half (2 ½) months after such Vesting \nDate or the date of the Participant’s death, as applicable), the Company shall deliver to the Participant a \nnumber of Shares equal to the number of RSUs subject to the Award that vest on such vesting event (or, \nin the case of the Participant’s Retirement or Disability, are scheduled to settle on such vesting event) \nless Tax-Related Items, unless such RSUs terminate prior to the applicable Vesting Date pursuant to \nSection 8. The Company’s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise settle vested RSUs is subject to the \ncondition precedent that the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any Shares with \nrespect to the vested RSUs deliver to the Company any representations or other documents or \nassurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan.  The Participant shall have no further rights \nwith respect to any RSUs that are settled or that are forfeited pursuant to Section 8.\n8.\nEffect of Termination of Service.\n(a) \nExcept as expressly provided in Section 4 or this Section 8, the Participant’s RSUs \n(as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall terminate and be forfeited to the extent such \nRSUs have not become vested prior to the date of the Participant’s Termination of Service (the \n“Severance Date”), regardless of the reason for the Participant’s Termination of Service, whether with or \nwithout cause, voluntarily or involuntarily, or whether the Participant was employed or provided services \nfor a portion of the vesting period prior to a Vesting Date.\n(b) \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise provided by the \nCommittee, in the event of the Participant’s Termination of Service due to the Participant’s Retirement \n(defined below) on or after the first anniversary of the Award Date, any unvested RSUs (as well as the \nrelated Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall continue to be eligible to vest on a pro rata basis (in accordance \n2\nwith the schedule set forth in the Grant Notice and Section 8(d)), without regard to the Participant’s \nTermination of Service, determined by multiplying (i)  the number of RSUs eligible to vest on the \napplicable Vesting Date, by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days that have \nelapsed between the Award Date and the Participant’s Retirement date, and the denominator of which \nshall be the total number of days contained in the period between the Award Date and the applicable \nVesting Date. For purposes of this Award Agreement, “Retirement” means the Participant’s Termination \nof Service on or after the Participant both has reached the age of sixty (60) and has completed ten (10) \nyears of service with the Company, or any Subsidiary (including service with any entity acquired by the \nCompany) as of the Severance Date, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. In the event \nthe Participant’s Termination of Service occurs prior to the first anniversary of the Award Date, this \nSection 8(b) shall not apply, unless the Committee shall otherwise determine in its sole discretion. For \npurposes of this Section 8(b), a Termination of Service shall not include the Participant’s Termination of \nService resulting from the Participant’s Disability or death (in which case Section 8(c) or 8(d), as \napplicable, will apply).\n(c) \nIn the event of the Participant’s Termination of Service due to the Participant’s \nDisability, any unvested RSUs shall continue to be eligible to vest in full (in accordance with the schedule \nset forth in the Grant Notice and Section 8(d)) without regard to the Participant’s Termination of Service.\n(d)\nIn the event of the Participant’s Termination of Service due to the Participant’s \ndeath, all unvested RSUs eligible to vest on Vesting Date(s) subsequent to the Participant’s death shall \naccelerate and vest immediately, and upon the Participant’s death following the Participant’s Termination \nof Service due to Disability or Retirement any RSUs that were eligible to vest in full, or pro rata in the case \nof Retirement, will be settled as soon as administratively practicable after the Participant’s death in \naccordance with Section 7.\n(e) \nIf any unvested RSUs are terminated hereunder, such RSUs (as well as the related \nDividend Equivalent Rights) shall automatically terminate and be canceled as of the applicable Severance \nDate without payment of any consideration by the Company and without any other action by the \nParticipant or the Participant’s beneficiary or personal representative, as the case may be.\n9.\nRecoupment.  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Award and any Shares or \nother amount or property that may be issued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any \nconsideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of any such Shares or \nproperty, shall be subject to any recoupment, “clawback” or similar provisions of Applicable Laws relevant \nto the Company’s Shares and any recoupment, “clawback” or similar policy maintained by the Company \nfrom time to time.  In addition, the Company may require the Participant to deliver or otherwise repay to \nthe Company the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be issued, delivered or \npaid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or \nother disposition of any such Shares or property, if the Company reasonably determines that one or more \nof the following has occurred:\n(a)\nduring the period of the Participant’s employment or service with the Company or \nany of its Subsidiaries (the “Employment Period”), the Participant has committed a felony (under the \nlaws of the United States or any relevant state, or a similar crime or offense under the applicable laws of \nany relevant foreign jurisdiction);\n(b)\nduring the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has \ncommitted or engaged in a breach of confidentiality, or an unauthorized disclosure or use of inside \ninformation, customer lists, trade secrets or other confidential information of the Company or any of its \nSubsidiaries;\n3\n(c)\nduring the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has \ncommitted or engaged in an act of theft, embezzlement or fraud, or materially breached any agreement to \nwhich the Participant is a party with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.\nFor purposes of the foregoing, the Participant expressly and explicitly authorizes the Company to \nissue instructions, on the Participant’s behalf, to any brokerage firm or third party administrator holding \nthe Participant’s Shares and/or other amounts acquired under the Plan to re-convey, transfer, or \notherwise return such Shares and/or other amounts to the Company. By accepting this Award, the \nParticipant further agrees to comply with any request or demand for repayment by the Company in order \nto comply with such policies or Applicable Laws. To the extent that the terms of this Agreement and any \nCompany recoupment policy conflict, the terms of the recoupment policy shall prevail. This Section 9 is \nnot the Company’s exclusive remedy with respect to such matters.\n10.\nAdjustments Upon Specified Events.  Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to \nthe Company’s stock contemplated by Section 11 of the Plan (including, without limitation, an \nextraordinary cash dividend on such stock), the Committee shall make adjustments in accordance with \nsuch section in the number of RSUs then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be \nissued in respect of the Award.  No such adjustment shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash \ndividend for which Dividend Equivalent Rights are credited pursuant to Section 5(b).\n11.\nResponsibility for Taxes.  The Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action \nthe Company and/or the Participant’s employer (“Employer”) take with respect to any Tax-Related Items, \nthe ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant’s responsibility and may \nexceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.  The Participant further \nacknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i)  make no representations or undertakings \nregarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, including \nthe grant of the RSUs, the vesting of the RSUs, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any \nShares acquired at vesting, and the receipt of any dividends and/or Dividend Equivalent Rights; and \n(ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the \nAward to reduce or eliminate the Participant’s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax \nresult.  Further, if the Participant is or becomes subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Participant \nacknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be \nrequired to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.\nPrior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or \nmake arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.  In \nthis regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at \ntheir discretion and pursuant to such procedures as they may specify from time to time, to satisfy any \napplicable withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the \nfollowing:\n(a) \nwithholding from any wages or other cash compensation, including short-term \ncash incentives, payable to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer;\n(b) \nwithholding otherwise deliverable Shares and/or from otherwise payable \nDividend Equivalent Rights to be issued or paid upon vesting/settlement of the Award;\n(c)  \narranging for the sale of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant (on the \nParticipant’s behalf and at the Participant’s direction pursuant to this authorization), including selling \nShares as part of a block trade with other Participants in the Plan;\n(d) \nwithholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon vesting/\nsettlement of the Award; or\n4\n(e) \nany other method of withholding determined by the Company to be permitted \nunder the Plan and, to the extent required by Applicable Law or under the Plan, approved by the \nCommittee.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is an officer of the Company who is subject to \nSection 16 of the Exchange Act, then the Company must satisfy any withholding obligations arising upon \nthe occurrence of a taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, by  withholding Shares otherwise \ndeliverable or an amount otherwise payable upon settlement of Dividend Equivalent Rights pursuant to \nmethod (b), unless the Board or the Committee determines in its discretion to satisfy the obligation for \nTax-Related Items by one or a combination of methods (a), (b), (c), and (d) above.\n \nThe Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory \nwithholding amounts or other withholding rates, including maximum rates applicable in the Participant’s \njurisdiction(s).  If the maximum rate is used, any over-withheld amount may be refunded to the Participant \nin cash by the Company or Employer (with no entitlement to the Share equivalent) or if not refunded, the \nParticipant may seek a refund from the local tax authorities.  In the event of under-withholding, the \nParticipant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items directly to the applicable tax authority or \nto the Company or Employer.  If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number \nof Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full \nnumber of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back \nsolely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.  The Company may refuse to issue or deliver to \nthe Participant any Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with the \nParticipant’s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.\n12.\nElectronic Delivery and Acceptance.  The Company may, in its sole discretion, deliver \nany documents related to the Award by electronic means or request the Participant’s consent to \nparticipate in the Plan by electronic means.

The Company and its related entities may \ntransfer Data amongst themselves as necessary for the purpose of implementation, administration, and \nmanagement of the Participant’s participation in the Plan, and the Company and its related entities may \neach further transfer Data to any third parties assisting the Company or any such related entity in the \nimplementation, administration, and management of the Plan.

The \nParticipant agrees to be bound by the terms of the Plan and this Award Agreement. The Participant \nacknowledges having read and understood the Plan, the Prospectus for the Plan, and this Award \nAgreement.  Unless otherwise expressly provided in other sections of this Award Agreement, provisions \nof the Plan that confer discretionary authority on the Board or the Committee do not (and shall not be \ndeemed to) create any rights in the Participant unless such rights are expressly set forth herein or are \notherwise in the sole discretion of the Board or the Committee so conferred by appropriate action of the \nBoard or the Committee under the Plan after the date hereof.\n16.\nEntire Agreement.  This Award Agreement and the Plan together constitute the entire \nagreement and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, written or oral, of the parties hereto \nwith respect to the subject matter hereof.  The Plan and this Award Agreement may be amended \npursuant to Section 15 of the Plan.  Such amendment must be in writing and signed by the Company.  \nThe Company may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver \ndoes not materially and adversely affect the interests of the Participant hereunder, but no such waiver \nshall operate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any other \nprovision hereof.\n17.\nLimitation on the Participant’s Rights.  Participation in the Plan confers no rights or \ninterests other than as herein provided.  This Award Agreement creates only a contractual obligation on \nthe part of the Company as to the RSUs and the settlement thereof and shall not be construed as \ncreating a trust.  Neither the Plan nor any underlying program, in and of itself, has any assets.  The \nParticipant shall have only the rights of a general unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to the \nsettlement of RSUs, and rights no greater than the right to receive the Shares as a general unsecured \ncreditor with respect to RSUs, as and when settled hereunder.\n18.\nSection Headings.

It is intended that the terms of the Award will not result in the imposition \nof any tax liability pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.  This Award Agreement shall be construed and \ninterpreted consistent with that intent.\n22.\nSeverability.  The provisions of this Award Agreement are severable and if any one of \nmore provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining \nprovisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.\n6\n23.\nImposition of Other Requirements.  The Company reserves the right to impose other \nrequirements on the Participant’s participation in the Plan, on the RSUs and on any Shares acquired \nunder the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or \nadministrative reasons, and to require the Participant to sign any additional agreements or undertakings \nthat may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.\n7\nAPPLE INC.\n2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PLAN\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT\nPERFORMANCE AWARD\nNOTICE OF GRANT\nName: \n(the “Participant”)\nEmployee ID: \nGrant Number: \nTarget No. of Units\nSubject to Award: \n \n \nAward Date: \n(the “Award Date”) \nVesting Date: \nPerformance Period: \nThis restricted stock unit award (the “Award”) is granted under and governed by the terms and \nconditions of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan and the Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock \nUnit Award - Performance Award (including Exhibit A thereto), which are incorporated herein by \nreference.\nYou do not have to accept the Award.

Any \nDividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be \nsubject to the same vesting, payment and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the original RSUs to \nwhich they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided, however, that the \namount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. For purposes of clarity, the \npercentage of the Dividend Equivalent Rights that are paid will correspond to the percentage of the total \ntarget number of RSUs that vest on the Vesting Date, after giving effect to Exhibit A. No crediting of \nDividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any RSUs which, \nas of the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated \npursuant to Section 8 or Exhibit A.\n6.\nRestrictions on Transfer.  Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, \nthe Dividend Equivalent Rights and any interest therein or amount or Shares issued in respect thereof \nshall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, alienated or encumbered, \neither voluntarily or involuntarily.\n7.\nTiming and Manner of Settlement of RSUs.  On or as soon as administratively practical \nfollowing the Vesting Date pursuant to Section 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and \none-half (2 ½) months after such Vesting Date), the Company shall deliver to the Participant a number of \nShares equal to the number of RSUs subject to the Award that vest on such vesting event (or, in the case \nof the Participant’s Retirement, death or Disability, are scheduled to settle on such vesting event), less \nTax-Related Items, unless such RSUs terminate prior to the Vesting Date pursuant to Section 8. The \nCompany’s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise settle vested RSUs is subject to the condition \nprecedent that the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any Shares with respect \nto the vested RSUs deliver to the Company any representations or other documents or assurances \nrequired pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to \nany RSUs that are settled or that are forfeited pursuant to Section 8.\n8.\nEffect of Termination of Service. \n(a)\nExcept as expressly provided in Section 4 or this Section 8, the Participant’s \nRSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall terminate and be forfeited to the extent \nsuch RSUs have not become vested prior to the date of the Participant’s Termination of Service (the \n“Severance Date”), regardless of the reason for the Participant’s Termination of Service, whether with or \nwithout cause, voluntarily or involuntarily or whether the Participant was employed or provided services \nfor a portion of the vesting period prior to a Vesting Date.\n(b)\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise provided by the \nCommittee, in the event of the Participant’s Termination of Service due to the Participant’s Retirement \n(defined below) on or after the first anniversary of the Award Date, death or Disability, any unvested \n2\nRSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall continue to be eligible to vest on the \nVesting Date without regard to the Participant’s Termination of Service. For purposes of this Award \nAgreement, “Retirement” means the Participant’s Termination of Service on or after the Participant both \nhas reached the age of sixty (60) and has completed ten (10) years of service with the Company, or any \nSubsidiary (including service with any entity acquired by the Company), as of the Severance Date, as \ndetermined in the sole discretion of the Committee. In the event the Participant’s Termination of Service \noccurs due to Retirement prior to the first anniversary of the Award Date, this Section 8(b) shall not apply, \nunless the Committee shall otherwise determine in its sole discretion.\n(c)\nIf any unvested RSUs are terminated hereunder, such RSUs (as well as the \nrelated Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall automatically terminate and be canceled as of the applicable \nSeverance Date (or, to the extent that any RSUs remain outstanding following the Severance Date by \nreason of Section 8(b) but the applicable performance-based vesting conditions are not satisfied, such \nRSUs shall automatically terminate and be canceled as of the Vesting Date, as provided in Exhibit A) \nwithout payment of any consideration by the Company and without any other action by the Participant, or \nthe Participant’s beneficiary or personal representative, as the case may be.\n9.\nRecoupment.  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Award and any Shares or \nother amount or property that may be issued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any \nconsideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of any such Shares or \nproperty, shall be subject to any recoupment, “clawback” or similar provisions of Applicable Laws relevant \nto the Company’s Shares and any recoupment, “clawback” or similar policy maintained by the Company \nfrom time to time. In addition, the Company may require the Participant to deliver or otherwise repay to \nthe Company the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be issued, delivered or \npaid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or \nother disposition of any such Shares or property, if the Company reasonably determines that one or more \nof the following has occurred:\n(a)\nduring the period of the Participant’s employment or service with the Company or \nany of its Subsidiaries (the “Employment Period”), the Participant has committed a felony (under the \nlaws of the United States or any relevant state, or a similar crime or offense under the applicable laws of \nany relevant foreign jurisdiction);\n(b)\nduring the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has \ncommitted or engaged in a breach of confidentiality, or an unauthorized disclosure or use of inside \ninformation, customer lists, trade secrets or other confidential information of the Company or any of its \nSubsidiaries;\n(c)\nduring the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has \ncommitted or engaged in an act of theft, embezzlement or fraud, or materially breached any agreement to \nwhich the Participant is a party with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.\nFor purposes of the foregoing, the Participant expressly and explicitly authorizes the Company to \nissue instructions, on the Participant’s behalf, to any brokerage firm and/or third party administrator \nholding the Participant’s Shares and/or other amounts acquired under the Plan to re-convey, transfer or \notherwise return such Shares and/or other amounts to the Company. By accepting this Award, the \nParticipant further agrees to comply with any request or demand for repayment by the Company in order \nto comply with such policies or Applicable Laws. To the extent that the terms of this Agreement and any \nCompany recoupment policy conflict, the terms of the recoupment policy shall prevail. This Section 9 is \nnot the Company’s exclusive remedy with respect to such matters.\n10.\nAdjustments Upon Specified Events.  Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to \nthe Company’s stock contemplated by Section 11 of the Plan (including, without limitation, an \nextraordinary cash dividend on such stock), the Committee shall make adjustments in accordance with \n3\nsuch section in the number of RSUs then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be \nissued in respect of the Award. No such adjustment shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash \ndividend for which Dividend Equivalent Rights are credited pursuant to Section 5(b).\n11.\nResponsibility for Taxes.  The Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action \nthe Company and/or the Participant’s employer (“Employer”) take with respect to any Tax-Related Items, \nthe ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant’s responsibility and may \nexceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further \nacknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i)  make no representations or undertakings \nregarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, including \nthe grant of the RSUs, the vesting of the RSUs, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any \nShares acquired at vesting and the receipt of any dividends and/or Dividend Equivalent Rights; and (ii) do \nnot commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Award \nto reduce or eliminate the Participant’s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. \nFurther, if the Participant is or becomes subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Participant \nacknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be \nrequired to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.\nPrior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or \nmake arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In \nthis regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at \ntheir discretion and pursuant to such procedures as they may specify from time to time, to satisfy any \napplicable withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the \nfollowing:\n(a) \nwithholding from any wages or other cash compensation, including short-term \ncash incentives, payable to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer;\n(b) \nwithholding otherwise deliverable Shares and/or from otherwise payable \nDividend Equivalent Rights to be issued or paid upon vesting/settlement of the Award;\n(c)  \narranging for the sale of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant (on the \nParticipant’s behalf and at the Participant’s direction pursuant to this authorization), including selling \nShares as part of a block trade with other Participants in the Plan;\n(d) \nwithholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon vesting/\nsettlement of the Award; or\n(e) \nany other method of withholding determined by the Company to be permitted \nunder the Plan and, to the extent required by Applicable Law or under the Plan, approved by the \nCommittee.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is an officer of the Company who is subject to \nSection 16 of the Exchange Act, then the Company must satisfy any withholding obligations arising upon \nthe occurrence of a taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, by  withholding Shares otherwise \ndeliverable or an amount otherwise payable upon settlement of Dividend Equivalent Rights pursuant to \nmethod (b), unless the Board or the Committee determines in its discretion to satisfy the obligation for \nTax-Related Items by one or a combination of methods (a), (b), (c), and (d) above.\n4\nThe Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory \nwithholding amounts or other withholding rates, including maximum rates applicable in the Participant's \njurisdictions(s). If the maximum rate is used, any over-withheld amount may be refunded to the Participant \nin cash by the Company or Employer (with no entitlement to the Share equivalent) or if not refunded, the \nParticipant may seek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, the \nParticipant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items directly to the applicable tax authority or \nto the Company or Employer. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number \nof Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full \nnumber of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back \nsolely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver to \nthe Participant any Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with the \nParticipant’s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.\n12.\nElectronic Delivery and Acceptance.  The Company may, in its sole discretion, deliver \nany documents related to the Award by electronic means or request the Participant’s consent to \nparticipate in the Plan by electronic means. The Participant hereby consents to receive all applicable \ndocumentation by electronic delivery and to participate in the Plan through an on-line or voice activated \nsystem established and maintained by the Company or a third party vendor designated by the Company.\n13.\nData Privacy.  By participating in the Plan, the Participant acknowledges and consents to \nthe collection, use, processing and transfer of personal data as described in this Section 13. The \nCompany, its related entities, and the Employer hold certain personal information about the Participant, \nincluding the Participant’s name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, \nsocial security number or other employee identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or \ndirectorships held in the Company, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to Shares or equivalent \nbenefits awarded, canceled, purchased, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Participant’s favor, for the \npurpose of managing and administering the Plan (“Data”). The Company and its related entities may \ntransfer Data amongst themselves as necessary for the purpose of implementation, administration and \nmanagement of the Participant’s participation in the Plan, and the Company and its related entities may \neach further transfer Data to any third parties assisting the Company or any such related entity in the \nimplementation, administration and management of the Plan. The Participant acknowledges that the \ntransferors and transferees of such Data may be located anywhere in the world and hereby authorizes \neach of them to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the \npurposes of implementing, administering and managing the Participant’s participation in the Plan, \nincluding any transfer of such Data as may be required for the administration of the Plan and/or the \nsubsequent holding of Shares on the Participant’s behalf to a broker or to other third party with whom the \nParticipant may elect to deposit any Shares acquired under the Plan (whether pursuant to the Award or \notherwise).\n14.\nNotices.  Any notice to be given under the terms of this Award Agreement shall be in \nwriting and addressed to the Company at its principal office to the attention of the Secretary, and to the \nParticipant at the Participant’s last address reflected on the Company’s records, or at such other address \nas either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other. Any such notice shall be given only when \nreceived, but if the Participant is no longer an employee of the Company, shall be deemed to have been \nduly given by the Company when enclosed in a properly sealed envelope addressed as aforesaid, \nregistered or certified, and deposited (postage and registry or certification fee prepaid) in a post office or \nbranch post office regularly maintained by the United States Government.\n15.\nPlan.  The Award and all rights of the Participant under this Award Agreement are \nsubject to the terms and conditions of the provisions of the Plan, incorporated herein by reference. The \nParticipant agrees to be bound by the terms of the Plan and this Award Agreement. The Participant \nacknowledges having read and understood the Plan, the Prospectus for the Plan, and this Award \nAgreement. Unless otherwise expressly provided in other sections of this Award Agreement, provisions of \nthe Plan that confer discretionary authority on the Board or the Committee do not (and shall not be \n5\ndeemed to) create any rights in the Participant unless such rights are expressly set forth herein or are \notherwise in the sole discretion of the Board or the Committee so conferred by appropriate action of the \nBoard or the Committee under the Plan after the date hereof.\n16.\nEntire Agreement.  This Award Agreement and the Plan together constitute the entire \nagreement and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, written or oral, of the parties hereto \nwith respect to the subject matter hereof. The Plan and this Award Agreement may be amended pursuant \nto Section  15 of the Plan. Such amendment must be in writing and signed by the Company. The \nCompany may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver does \nnot materially and adversely affect the interests of the Participant hereunder, but no such waiver shall \noperate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any other \nprovision hereof.\n17.\nLimitation on the Participant’s Rights.  Participation in the Plan confers no rights or \ninterests other than as herein provided. This Award Agreement creates only a contractual obligation on \nthe part of the Company as to the RSUs and the settlement thereof and shall not be construed as \ncreating a trust. Neither the Plan nor any underlying program, in and of itself, has any assets. The \nParticipant shall have only the rights of a general unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to the \nsettlement of RSUs, and rights no greater than the right to receive the Shares as a general unsecured \ncreditor with respect to RSUs, as and when settled hereunder.\n18.\nSection Headings.  The section headings of this Award Agreement are for convenience \nof reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect any provision hereof.\n19.\nGoverning Law.  This Award Agreement shall be governed by and construed and \nenforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California and applicable U.S. federal laws without \nregard to conflict of law principles thereunder.\n20.\nChoice of Venue.  For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly \nfrom the relationship of the parties evidenced by this grant or this Award Agreement, the parties hereby \nsubmit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that such litigation shall be \nconducted only in the courts of Santa Clara County, California, or the federal courts for the Northern \nDistrict of California, and no other courts, where this grant is made or to be performed.\n21.\nConstruction.  It is intended that the terms of the Award will not result in the imposition \nof any tax liability pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. This Award Agreement shall be construed and \ninterpreted consistent with that intent.\n22.\nSeverability.  The provisions of this Award Agreement are severable and if any one of \nmore provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining \nprovisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.\n23.\nImposition of Other Requirements.  The Company reserves the right to impose other \nrequirements on the Participant’s participation in the Plan, on the RSUs and on any Shares acquired \nunder the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or \nadministrative reasons, and to require the Participant to sign any additional agreements or undertakings \nthat may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.\n* * * * *\n6\nPERFORMANCE AWARD\nEXHIBIT A\nPERFORMANCE VESTING REQUIREMENTS\nThe RSUs (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) subject to the Award that will vest on the \nVesting Date will be determined based on the Company’s relative total shareholder return (“TSR”) \nPercentile for the Performance Period.\nThe percentage of the RSUs (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) that vest on the Vesting \nDate will be determined as follows:\n•\nIf the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [     ] ([     ]) \npercentile or greater, [     ] ([     ]%) of the target RSUs will vest on the Vesting Date.\n•\nIf the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [     ] ([     ]) \npercentile, [     ] ([     ]%) of the target RSUs will vest on the Vesting Date.\n•\nIf the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [     ] ([     ]) \npercentile, [     ] ([     ]%) of the target RSUs will vest on the Vesting Date.\n•\nIf the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is below the [     ]    ([     ]) \npercentile, [     ] ([     ]%) of the RSUs will vest on the Vesting Date.\nFor TSR Percentile performance for the Performance Period between the levels indicated above, \nthe portion of the RSUs that will vest on the Vesting Date will be determined on a straight-line basis (i.e., \nlinearly interpolated) between the two nearest vesting percentages indicated above.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company’s TSR for the Performance Period is negative, in \nno event shall more than one hundred percent (100%) of the target RSUs vest.\nThe number of RSUs that vest on the Vesting Date will be rounded to the nearest whole unit, and \nthe balance of the RSUs will not vest and will terminate on that Vesting Date.\n \nFor purposes of the Award, the following definitions will apply:\n•\n“TSR Percentile” means the percentile ranking of the Company’s TSR among the TSRs \nfor the Comparison Group members for the Performance Period. In determining the \nCompany’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period, in the event that the Company’s \nTSR for the Performance Period is equal to the TSR(s) of one or more other Comparison \nGroup members for that same period, the Company’s TSR Percentile ranking will be \ndetermined by ranking the Company’s TSR for that period as being greater than such \nother Comparison Group members.\n•\n“Comparison Group” means the Company and each other company included in the \nStandard & Poor’s 500 Index on the first day of the Performance Period and, except as \nprovided below, the common stock (or similar equity security) of which continues to be \nlisted or traded on a national securities exchange through the last trading day of the \nPerformance Period. In the event a member of the Comparison Group files for \nbankruptcy or liquidates due to an insolvency, such company shall continue to be treated \nas a Comparison Group member, and such company’s Ending Price will be treated as $0 \nif the common stock (or similar equity security) of such company is no longer listed or \nA-1\ntraded on a national securities exchange on the last trading day of the Performance \nPeriod. In the event of a formation of a new parent company by a Comparison Group \nmember, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of which consist immediately after \nthe transaction of the equity interests in the original Comparison Group member or the \nassets and liabilities of such Comparison Group member immediately prior to the \ntransaction, such new parent company shall be substituted for the Comparison Group \nmember to the extent (and for such period of time) as its common stock (or similar equity \nsecurities) are listed or traded on a national securities exchange but the common stock \n(or similar equity securities) of the original Comparison Group member are not. In the \nevent of a merger or other business combination of two Comparison Group members \n(including, without limitation, the acquisition of one Comparison Group member, or all or \nsubstantially all of its assets, by another Comparison Group member), the surviving, \nresulting or successor entity, as the case may be, shall continue to be treated as a \nmember of the Comparison Group, provided that the common stock (or similar equity \nsecurity) of such entity is listed or traded on a national securities exchange through the \nlast trading day of the Performance Period. With respect to the preceding two sentences, \nthe applicable stock prices shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted to the extent (if \nany) necessary to preserve the intended incentives of the awards and mitigate the impact \nof the transaction.\n•\n“TSR” shall be determined with respect to the Company and any other Comparison \nGroup member by dividing: (a) the sum of (i) the difference obtained by subtracting the \napplicable Beginning Price from the applicable Ending Price and (ii)  all dividends and \nother distributions during the Performance Period by (b) the applicable Beginning Price. \nAny non-cash distributions shall be valued at fair market value. For the purpose of \ndetermining TSR, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined by \ntreating them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at the closing market price on \nthe date of distribution.\n•\n“Beginning Price” means, with respect to the Company and any other Comparison \nGroup member, the average of the closing market prices of such company’s common \nstock on the principal exchange on which such stock is traded for the twenty (20) \nconsecutive trading days beginning with the first trading day of the Performance Period. \nFor the purpose of determining Beginning Price, the value of dividends and other \ndistributions shall be determined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of \nstock at the closing market price on the date of distribution.\n•\n“Ending Price” means, with respect to the Company and any other Comparison Group \nmember, the average of the closing market prices of such company’s common stock on \nthe principal exchange on which such stock is traded for the twenty (20) consecutive \ntrading days ending on the last trading day of the Performance Period. For the purpose of \ndetermining Ending Price, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be \ndetermined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at the closing \nmarket price on the date of distribution.\n \nWith respect to the computation of TSR, Beginning Price, and Ending Price, there shall also be \nan equitable and proportionate adjustment to the extent (if any) necessary to preserve the intended \nincentives of the awards and mitigate the impact of any stock split, stock dividend or reverse stock split \noccurring during the Performance Period (or during the applicable twenty (20)-day period in determining \nBeginning Price or Ending Price, as the case may be).\n \nIn the event of any ambiguity or discrepancy, the determination of the Committee shall be final \nand binding.\n* * * * *\nA-2\nInsider Trading Policy\nExhibit 19.1\nThis policy is designed to prevent trading of securities when a person is aware of \nmaterial nonpublic information.\nTrading while aware of material nonpublic information is a crime. Penalties for insider trading can \ninclude significant fines, monetary damages and prison time. In the United States, the Securities and \nExchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the Department of Justice prioritize these types of cases. \nThey dedicate significant resources and use sophisticated electronic surveillance techniques to \nidentify illegal trading activities. The reason for the transaction, size of the transaction, or the amount \nof profit received does not have to be significant — even small insider trading violations may be \nmonitored, aggressively investigated, and prosecuted. Agencies outside of the United States take a \nsimilar approach under local insider trading laws.\nWho is Covered by this Policy?\nThis policy applies to all Apple personnel, including directors, officers, employees, independent \ncontractors, and consultants. It also applies to family members who reside with you or are financially \ndependent on you, and any other person or entity whose transactions in securities are directed by you \nor are subject to your influence or control. This includes entities such as family trusts, partnerships and \nfoundations. You must ensure that people and entities whose trading activities you directly or indirectly \ninfluence or control, or those whose trading activity would reasonably be perceived by others to be \nunder your influence or control, comply with the terms of this policy.\nInsider Trading Prohibitions\nNo Trading While Aware of Material Nonpublic Information. Never buy or sell Apple securities \nwhen aware of information that has not been publicly announced and that could have a material effect \non the value of the securities. Information should be considered nonpublic for at least 24 hours after it \nhas been distributed to the general public.\nNo Tipping. Do not disclose (“tip”) material nonpublic information to other persons, including \nfamily members, or make any recommendation about whether to buy or sell Apple securities while \naware of material nonpublic information.\nNo Third-Party Trading or Tipping. Do not trade in the securities of another company when aware \nof material nonpublic information about that company in connection with your work at Apple. This \nincludes trading in the stock of Apple suppliers, manufacturers, vendors or customers, such as \ncellular network carriers or other business partners. You must also not tip material nonpublic \ninformation about another company.\nNo Trading During Restricted Trading Periods. If you are subject to a restricted trading period, \nyou must not buy or sell Apple securities while trading restrictions are in effect.\nNo Short Sales, Hedging or Trading in Derivatives. Short sales, transactions that hedge or offset, \nor are designed to hedge or offset, any decrease in the value of Apple securities, and transactions in \nderivatives of Apple securities, are prohibited at all times. This includes transactions involving prepaid \nvariable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, options, warrants, puts, calls, or similar instruments \nrelated to Apple securities. Additionally, members of Apple’s Board of Directors and executive officers \nare prohibited from pledging Apple stock as collateral.\nUpdated September 2024\n2\nIn addition to the above prohibitions, this policy includes important additional information.\n“Material” Nonpublic Information\nDetermining whether information is “material” requires consideration of all relevant facts and \ncircumstances. In general, information is material if it would likely be considered important by an \ninvestor who is deciding whether to buy or sell a security, or if the information is likely to have a \nsignificant effect on the market price of the security. Both positive and negative information may be \nmaterial. “Materiality” is different for different companies. Information that is not material to Apple may \nbe material to another company. \n“Nonpublic” Information\n“Nonpublic” information means information that has not been previously disclosed to the general \npublic and is otherwise not available to the general public. Information should be considered nonpublic \nfor at least 24 hours after it has been distributed to the general public through a press release, filing \nwith the SEC, or similar means. The circulation of rumors, even if accurate and reported in the media, \nis not considered effective public distribution.\nPolicy Violations\nApple personnel who violate this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, including termination \nof employment and repayment of equity awards. Additionally, individuals who engage in illegal \ninsider trading or tipping can be liable for substantial criminal and civil penalties.\nIf you have any doubt whether information is public or material, or have questions about this \npolicy, consult Apple’s team by emailing [***] or calling [***].\nUpdated September 2024\n3\nRestricted Trading Periods and Trading Windows\nA restricted trading period is a specified period of time during which designated Apple personnel, \nand their covered family members and entities, may not buy or sell Apple securities. If you are \nsubject to trading restrictions, you will be notified by Apple’s Corporate Legal team.\nA trading window (sometimes referred to as an “open trading window”) is a specified period of time \nduring which Apple personnel may buy or sell Apple securities, so long as the individual is not aware \nof material nonpublic information. Complying with restricted trading periods and trading windows may \nprotect you and Apple from regulatory investigations or insider trading allegations. However, even if \nyou are not subject to restricted trading periods or no such period is in effect, you must not trade in \nApple securities if you are aware of material nonpublic information about Apple.\nThe regularly scheduled restricted trading period and trading window for each quarter is indicated below.\nFiscal \nQuarter\nTrading Window \nClosed and Trading \nRestrictions Begin\nTrading Restrictions End and Trading Window Opens\n1st\nDecember 1\n24 hours after public disclosure of first-quarter results (typically \nearly February)\n2nd\nMarch 1\n24 hours after public disclosure of second-quarter results (typically \nearly May)\n3rd\nJune 1\n24 hours after public disclosure of third-quarter results (typically \nearly August)\n4th\nSeptember 1\n24 hours after public disclosure of year-end results (typically early \nNovember)\nIn addition to these regularly scheduled restricted trading periods, Apple may impose a special \nrestricted trading period or extend a restricted trading period if necessary. If you become subject to a \nspecial or extended restricted trading period, you will be notified by Apple’s Corporate Legal team. If \nyou are notified about a special or extended restricted trading period, you should not discuss it with \nothers.\nPermitted Transactions\nThe transactions listed below are not subject to this policy’s restrictions, including during \nrestricted trading periods and open trading windows:\n•\nVesting of restricted stock unit awards and the withholding of shares by Apple to \nsatisfy tax-withholding requirements upon vesting;\n•\nPurchases under Apple’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan;\n•\nCash-settled stock option exercises under Apple’s equity plans (i.e., cash-\nsettled “exercise and hold” transactions);\n•\nTransactions pursuant to a previously established contract, plan or instruction to \ntrade in Apple’s securities (a “Trading Plan”) entered in accordance with Rule \n10b5-1 (“Rule 10b5-1”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended \n(the “Act”), and acknowledged by Apple’s Corporate Legal team; and\n•\nBona fide gifts for estate planning purposes, including gifts to a trust, family limited \npartnership, charitable foundation or similar entity, as long as you or members of \nyour immediate family remain the sole beneficiaries of the transferred shares and \nthe terms of the transfer ensure that the shares remain subject to the same \nUpdated September 2024\n4\nrestrictions that apply to you under this policy; provided, however, that in all other \ninstances gifts of securities are subject to this policy, including the prohibition on \ntrading during a restricted trading period and the requirement for Designated \nIndividuals to seek pre-clearance. \nAdditional Information Regarding Section 16 and Designated Individuals\nApple’s General Counsel and one or more authorized delegates serve as Apple’s Insider \nTrading Compliance Officer.\nMembers of the Board of Directors, executive officers and certain other individuals designated by \nApple’s Insider Trading Compliance Officer, and family members who reside with them or are financially \ndependent on them, and any other person or entity who such individuals direct, influence, or control (or \nmay be reasonably perceived to direct, influence, or control), are subject to additional restrictions. These \nindividuals and their covered family members and entities are referred to as “Designated Individuals.” \nYou will be notified by Apple’s Corporate Legal team if these restrictions apply to you.\nExcept for those permitted transactions listed above, all Designated Individuals must pre-clear all \ntransactions in Apple securities with Apple’s Insider Trading Compliance Officer.

Introduction\nThis Rule 10D-1 Recovery Policy (the “Policy”) is administered by the People and \nCompensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. (the “Committee”), and \ncovers Incentive-Based Compensation granted, awarded or paid by Apple Inc. or any of \nits subsidiaries (“Apple”) to any employee who is an “executive officer” of Apple (each a \n“Covered Executive”) as defined under Section 10D-1 of the Securities and Exchange \nAct  of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). The Policy is intended to comply with, and as applicable \nto be administered and interpreted consistent with, and subject to the exceptions set \nforth in, Listing Rule 5608 adopted by the Nasdaq Stock Market to implement Rule \n10D-1 under the Exchange Act (collectively referred to herein as “Rule 10D-1”). For \navoidance of doubt the Policy only applies to Covered Executives who served as a \nCovered Executive for Apple at any point during the performance period for any \nIncentive-Based Compensation that is Received on or after October 2, 2023. The Policy \nexplains when Apple will be required to seek recovery of erroneously awarded \nIncentive-Based Compensation from a Covered Executive.  \nB. Incentive-Based Compensation\nFor purposes of this Policy, “Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation \ngranted, earned or vested based in whole or in part upon the attainment of one or more \nfinancial reporting measures, that was Received (i) on or after October 2, 2023 and (ii) \nby a person who served as a Covered Executive at any time during the performance \nperiod for the Incentive-Based Compensation. Financial reporting measures are (i) any \nmeasure(s) that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting \nprinciples used in Apple’s financial statements and any measure(s) derived in whole or \nin part from such measure(s) and (ii) any measure(s) that are based in whole or in part \non Apple’s stock price or total shareholder return. For avoidance of doubt, Incentive-\nBased Compensation includes awards granted to a Covered Executive that are \noutstanding and unvested as of October 2, 2023. Incentive-Based Compensation is \n“Received” in the fiscal period that the relevant financial reporting measure is attained \nregardless of when it is paid or awarded.\nFor avoidance of doubt, incentive-based compensation that is not earned or vested \nbased on the attainment of one or more financial measures, including but not limited to \ntime-based restricted stock units, is not covered compensation under this Policy but \nmay be recouped under the Apple Inc. Executive Team Compensation Recoupment \nPolicy. \nExhibit 97.1\nC. Administration\nThe Committee is authorized and directed to consult with the full Board or such other \ncommittees of the Board as may be necessary or appropriate for the administration of \nthis Policy and engage third parties as it deems necessary to evaluate erroneously \nawarded Incentive-Based Compensation Received. If the Committee determines \nIncentive-Based Compensation was erroneously awarded and recovery is required \npursuant to this Policy, Apple shall make any required disclosures for any affected \nCovered Executives in its annual proxy statement. Apple will maintain and will provide to \nthe Nasdaq Stock Market documentation of all determinations and actions taken in \ncomplying with the Policy.  Any determinations made by the Committee under this \nPolicy shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.  \nD. Section 10D-1 Recovery \nPursuant to Rule 10D-1, the Committee will make reasonable efforts to recover any \nIncentive-Based Compensation Received by any Covered Executive during the three \ncompleted fiscal years immediately preceding the date that Apple is required to prepare \nan Accounting Restatement under Rule 10D-1 and any transition period of less than \nnine months that is within or immediately following such three years if the Committee \ndetermines the Incentive-Based Compensation was erroneously awarded. An \n“Accounting Restatement” is a correction to Apple’s financial statements that, due to \nApple’s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under U.S. \nfederal securities laws, is (1) is material to a prior financial reporting period or (2) would \nbe material to the current financial reporting period if corrected in the current period or \nleft uncorrected in the current period.  \nRecovery will be limited to the amount of the gross, pre-tax, Incentive-Based \nCompensation that was erroneously Received because it exceeded the amount that \nwould have been Received had it been determined based on any restated financial \nmeasures in the Accounting Restatement. If the Incentive-Based Compensation is \nbased on stock price or total shareholder return, the Committee shall determine a \nreasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement, if any, on the stock \nprice or total shareholder return and based on that reasonable estimate, whether \nIncentive-Based Compensation was erroneously awarded. \nIf the erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation cannot be recovered \nbecause recovery efforts are excessively burdensome, the recovery value exceeds the \ncost of recovery to Apple or recovery would be contrary to laws outside the United \nStates, each as determined in accordance with Rule 10D-1, the Committee will make a \ndetermination whether further recovery efforts would be in shareholders’ best interests \nand should continue or would otherwise be excusable under Rule 10D-1.\n2\nIf the Committee determines a Covered Executive Received erroneously awarded \nIncentive-Based Compensation, the Committee shall determine the timing and method \nof recovery in its sole direction and direct Apple to recover any erroneously awarded \namounts as soon as administratively practicable. The methods of recovery include but \nare not limited to, requiring reimbursement from the Covered Executive, electing to \nwithhold or suspend unpaid Incentive-Based Compensation, by offset (subject to the \nrequirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \n“Code”) if applicable), forcing the sale of shares issued pursuant to Incentive-Based \nCompensation, rescinding, cancelling, or otherwise causing the forfeiture of any \nunvested or unpaid Incentive-Based Compensation, deducting from amounts otherwise \npayable to the Covered Executive including base salary, commissions, time-based \nequity awards or other compensation, or by requiring incremental payments from the \nCovered Executive using one or more of the above methods or any other methods \nauthorized by applicable law. \nApple shall not indemnify any Covered Executive for the loss of any Incentive-Based \nCompensation or the cost of any third-party insurance to cover the same.\nE. Rights and Remedies; Waiver; Amendment; Extension\nThis Policy shall supplement and not limit any other rights or remedies Apple may have \nunder applicable law, any other Apple policy, including the Apple Inc. Executive Team \nCompensation Recoupment Policy, any applicable plan, agreement, other arrangement, \nor otherwise, including, but not limited to, termination of employment, initiation of other \ndisciplinary procedures, and/or the institution of civil or criminal proceedings, provided \nhowever, if Incentive-Based Compensation is recovered under this Policy it would not \nbe subject to double recovery under any other Apple policy, plan, agreement or \narrangement unless specifically required under applicable law.\nThis Policy may from time to time be waived, amended, or extended to other employees \nof Apple, as determined by the Committee, or as otherwise required under Rule 10D-1.\n***\n3",
